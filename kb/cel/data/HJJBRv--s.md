[Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs) are design documents providing information to the Filecoin community about a proposal to change and/or add new features to Filecoin's protocol. Anyone can submit a FIP, and anyone can comment on FIP drafts. The acceptance of FIPs is governed by a [workflow](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0001.md#fip-work-flow) targetted to reach consensus and uncover any issues around the proposal.

CryptoEconLab is involved in the FIP process in two main capacities:

1. As **authors** of FIPs - being an economic-aware member of the Filecoin community, CryptoEcon strives to monitor the network closely and propose changes that will support the long-time growth and health of the network,
2. As **reviewers** of FIPs - changes in the Filecoin protocol usually touch the economics of the network, and, in those cases, CryptEconLab builds analysis and technical opinions about the proposed changes.

In this section of the Almanac, we link to all previous analyses conducted around FIPs (both as authors and reviewers).
