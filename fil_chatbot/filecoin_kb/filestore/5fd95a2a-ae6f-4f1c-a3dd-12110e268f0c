Sectors with FIl+ deals continue to generate better returns than CC sectors. In terms of total return, longer sectors generate higher returns than shorter sectors. However, in annualized return, shorter sectors will be preferable during the first few years, which may cause **some SPs to continue to seal shorter sectors in the beginning**.\n* **Smaller slopes** in the duration multiplier funtion are **preferable**. Larger slopes introduce more time-volitility without a gain in SPs' long-term profitability.", "metadata": {}}}
