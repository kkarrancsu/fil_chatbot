Baseline Crossing and Impact Scenarios\n\n#### Scenario Exploration\n\nTo build intuition about the outcome from different scenarios, we examined [54 scenarios](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/blob/baseline-crossing-updated/notebooks/baseline_crossing/baseline_crossing_scenarios_v2.ipynb) which capture a range of future storage provider behavior in the Filecoin network. \n\nScenarios are constructed by specifying storage provider behavior metrics across the simulation time frame. Different signatures of metrics correspond to different storage provider engagement with Filecoin. The inputs that we focus on are Raw-Byte (RB) onboarding power, sector renewal rate and Filecoin Plus growth rate. \n\nFig. 6 shows the case where RB onboarding power, sector renewal rate, and FIL+ rate exponentially grow or decay to a defined percentage of their historical maximum (ranging from 10% to 90%) 180 days after simulation start.", "metadata": {}}}
