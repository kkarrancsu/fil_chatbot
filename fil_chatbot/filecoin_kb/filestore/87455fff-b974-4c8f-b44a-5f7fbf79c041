To do this, it is simpler to start from the scheduled renewals in RB power and apply the new multiplier:\n\n$$R_{t}^{QA} = m_{dur}(d) \\cdot (1 + (m_{Fil+}-1) * \\textrm{fil_plus_rate}) \\cdot r_t \\cdot SE_{t}^{RB} $$\n\nThis is in line with the assumption that renewed sectors will have the same Fil+ rate and duration as the new onboarded sectors.", "metadata": {}}}
