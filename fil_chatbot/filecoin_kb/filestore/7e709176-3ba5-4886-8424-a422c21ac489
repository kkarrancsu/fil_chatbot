While we have proposed several utility functions in this report to quantify the benefit that various stakeholders would have with respect to changes in the base fee and demand, it is important to note that these functions are not unique and may differ depending on the assumptions and values used. Additionally, the utility functions presented in this report may not capture all aspects of a stakeholder's interest and may not be applicable in all situations. Therefore, the results and conclusions based on these functions should be interpreted with caution and considered as a starting point for further analysis and discussion.*\n\n**Simple payer's utility**", "metadata": {}}}
