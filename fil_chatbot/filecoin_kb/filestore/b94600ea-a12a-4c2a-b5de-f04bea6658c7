The approach presented in this report is intended to be a \"back-of-the-envelope\" estimation for guidance purposes. It should not be relied upon for making critical decisions or pursuing specific business directions. To fully grasp the equivalence of gas units between networks, a thorough gas profiling and analysis must be conducted by seasoned developers, taking into account the nature of the operations, the gas unit values for specific tasks, and the gas prices and token conversion rates at the time of comparison.
