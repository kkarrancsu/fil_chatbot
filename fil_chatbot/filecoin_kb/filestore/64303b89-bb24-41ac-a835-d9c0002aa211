This decreased width results in a smaller number of transactions being included in that lane, effectively increasing the gas fee for that lane. However, since the sum of lane widths is kept constant at $B_\\text{max}$, the capacity that is removed from this lane will be reallocated to other lanes with higher congestion levels. This reallocation helps maintain a balance between the lanes, ensuring that storage providers have a fair chance of being included in the network without being priced-out by other users. \n\n\n### 3.2 Variable target block-size.", "metadata": {}}}
