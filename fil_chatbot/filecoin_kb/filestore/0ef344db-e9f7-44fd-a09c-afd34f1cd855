They bring capital from the outside to buy the native token (QRDO) and use that token to support validator operations and increase security and confidence in the protocol. For this, they are also compensated, which usually takes the form of minted tokens. Validators and Clients can be Stakers, which is fairly common in other blockchain economies. Staker behavior is super important to understand token flows as they directly impact both inflows and outflows - when they stake, they remove tokens from circulation, thus increasing demand, and when they un-stake, they add tokens to circulation, thus increasing supply.", "metadata": {}}}
