There is a target block size, we call $B^T$, which is the optimal amount of gas the blockchain can consistently process. \n\nThe actual blocksize that gets commited to the chain is actually flexible, and depends on the number of users who can afford the current base fee. There is a maximum block size of $2B^T$.\n\nWe call $B_t$ the actual realized block size at time $t$. Also $b_t$ is the base fee at that time. The base fee updating rule is then \n$$b_{t+\\varepsilon}=\\left(1+c\\frac{B_t-B^T}{B^T}\\right)b_t$$\nwith the constant set at $c=1/8$, and $\\varepsilon$ is the epoch duration.\n\n*We wish to derive a continuous time version of this base fee evolution, which we could use to make simpler gas models*. The time variable heres, $t$ is defined only in discrete epochs.\n\n### Continuous limit?", "metadata": {}}}
