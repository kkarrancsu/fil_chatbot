Service fees tipped to the network are added to the fund while tokens released to cover staking rewards and protocol fees are removed from the fund. \n\nTo avoid circular dependencies, we assume that the Ecosystem Fund at step $t+1$ depends only on the tokens flows from step $t$. This is the same as saying that, in any given simulation step, tokens in the Ecosystem Fund are released before new tokens being locked. Therefore:\n\n$$\n\\mathsf{EcosystemFund}(t+1) = \n    \\mathsf{EcosystemFund}(t)\n    + L_\\text{fee}^\\text{in}(t)\n    - L_\\text{burn}^\\text{out}(t)\n    - L_\\text{fee}^\\text{out}(t)\n$$\n\nFinally, $L_\\text{stake}^\\text{out}(t)$ depends solely on the decisions of users to decrease their stake in the consensus mechanism. Thus, this variable will be an input of this model. We will discuss how we will model this variable in [Section 2](#2-Model-inputs-parameters-and-possible-scenarios).", "metadata": {}}}
