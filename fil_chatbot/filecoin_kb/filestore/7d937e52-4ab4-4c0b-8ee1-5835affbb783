This is the percentage of power that will renew at $t$ out of all the power scheduled to expire at $t$\n* $lo$: average duration of the sectors after onboarding\n* $lr$: average duration of the sectors after renewal\n\nNote that all RB notations have an equivalent notation in QA. As an example, the $P_t^{QA}$ is defined to be the total QA power at step $t$.\n\n\n## Raw-byte power", "metadata": {}}}
