The latter could, for instance, be set at $B_\u2113^* = B_\\ell / 2$. Under this setup, opcodes of class $\\ell$ can use up to $B_\\ell$ gas units (i.e., it holds that $G_{\\ell,t}\\leq B_\\ell$ for any epoch $t$). This ensures better control over base fee changes. However, the downside is limited flexibility in opcode inclusion, which could lead to missed message inclusions. Indeed, notice that setting $B^*_\\ell:=\\alpha B_\\ell$, for some $\\alpha$ taking values between 0 and 1, implies that the base fee $b_t$ increases **by at most** $100\\times\\frac{1-\\alpha}{8\\alpha}$% on an epoch to epoch basis, and decreases by at most 12.5% at each epoch. Indeed, to see this, notice that since $G_{\\ell,t}\\leq B_{\\ell}$,  one then has that\n\\begin{aligned}", "metadata": {}}}
