In other words, since it is always true by construction that $g_s(1 - d) > 0$, and $\\lim_{M\\to\\infty} \\frac{g_B}{M} = 0$, miners should increase batching such that $N_B < N_S$ (per unit cost of batching is less than the per unit cost of submitting single proofs) \n\n\n### Case 3: $\\beta*d < B < \\beta$\n\nHere, the network *BaseFee*, $B$ is less than the *BatchBalancer*, $\\beta$ , but greater than the *BatchBalancer* * *BatchDiscount*.
