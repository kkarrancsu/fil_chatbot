There is always the risk of assumptions having been too oversimplified, or inaccurate, leading to a misleading result.\n\n* There is a large risk of community misalignment. Gas fee burning is a sensitive economic issue, where different network stakeholders may have different strong opinions. Trying to align the network to obtain a viable network target to optimize may prove a very difficult task. In any case, we plan all of our reports to include several possible target functions, providing different options, rather than making final choices ourselves.", "metadata": {}}}
