When the transaction is executed, the protocol takes the protocol fees from the user\u2019s wallet and burns them.\n\nOn the other hand, protocol-funded transactions and control transactions cannot be directly charged to a user\u2019s wallet. Instead, the protocol fees for these transactions need to be covered by an Ecosystem Fund that is fully controlled by the protocol. \n\nEverytime a transactions is executed within Qredo, a **fixed protocol fee is collected and burned by the protocol**. This burning model garantees that Validators also pay fees for submitting their own transactions while creating a token supply pressure that benefits all network participants that hold QRDO.\n\nThe fixed fee value by transaction will be defined in the second phase of this project by trying to balance the following two goals:", "metadata": {}}}
