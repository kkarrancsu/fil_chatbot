What is the maximum level of demand, understood either in terms of the percentage of the block size used or as the amount of gas required by messages in the Mpool, that the network can withstand without negatively impacting storage providers? Here we mean impact in the broadest sense; increase in price, average number of epochs to get a message included, average increase in price, probability of commiting a fault due to excessively high base fees, to name a few. \n2. How could we quantify the impact of such an increase in demand? \n3. How would the demand for block space compare between FVM and non-FVM users? i.e., how sensitive are these users' consumptions to a change in the base fee?\n4. What are the most susceptible quantities to this change in demand?\n5. How does Mpool size and congestion affect block space?\n6. How will the block composition change as a function of the base fee?", "metadata": {}}}
