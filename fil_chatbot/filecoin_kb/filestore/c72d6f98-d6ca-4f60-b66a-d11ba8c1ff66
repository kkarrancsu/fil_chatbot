Say the sector is sealed with a FIL+ deal, using $\\chi_1$ amount of space, for a duration $l_1$. We assume the deal starts at the beginning of the sector lifetime.\n\nAs currently implemented, the sector has a constant quality multiplier, $q$, which is assigned for the whole duration of the sector lifetime, even after the deal has expired. This multiplier is computed as\n\n$$q=\\frac{m\\chi_1l_1+(\\mathcal{X}-\\chi_1)l_1+(L-l_1)\\mathcal{X}}{\\mathcal{X}L},$$\nwhere $m=10$ is the quality boost associated with FIL+ deals.", "metadata": {}}}
