This is mostly used in heuristics where we can easily define what is *impossible*.\n2. **Statistical outliers:** here we use data from the test version of Saturn to model the statistical distribution of the underlying metric. Thus, we assume that the data follows a known distribution and that it will be representative of future requests. This test version is running with internal nodes, which means that the observed metrics from real users may be slightly different. However, this is the best approximation we have at the moment. Once we have the distribution for the metric, we set the percentile 99.999 or 0.0001 (1/10000) of the fitted distribution as the threshold candidate.", "metadata": {}}}
