This price is typically given in terms of tokens per gas unit. It is given in the native token of the network (e.g., FIL per gas unit in Filecoin, ETH/per gas unit in Ethereum, etc.). In Filecoin, Ethereum, and Polygon, this *Gas Price* is referred to as *Base Fee* and gets adjusted on an epoch-to-epoch basis to network congestion, according to the well-known *EIP-1559 mechanism*\n\n3. **Token Price:** This is the current market price of the network token (e.g., ETH or MATIC) in dollars. Since the cost of FIL and MATIC are (much) lower than the price of ETH, transactions in Filecoin and Polygon are generally cheaper than transactions in Ethereum.", "metadata": {}}}
