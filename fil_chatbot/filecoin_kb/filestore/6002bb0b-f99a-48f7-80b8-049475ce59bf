Examples include L1s cache missing to L2s and L2s cache missing to SP's.\n\nAt the moment, measuring geographical coverage and adherence to Saturn's design will be tricky and, as such, it is out of scope for the Treasury release in October. We are noting the behaviors here for future iterations.\n\nThus, first three behaviors are used to design the formula for distributing rewards among Saturn nodes. Next, we discuss in more detail what each of the 3 behaviors entail and what metrics could be used to measure them.\n\n**High-bandwidth service**", "metadata": {}}}
