This is calculated as the percentage annualized FIL-on-FIL return, which is given by ((Minted - Gas + Pledge) / Pledge) ** (duration/1year)) - 1. It is estimated using the circulating supply and network power projections from the macro model. The percentage return considers the gas fees, the rewards and the initial pledge expected for a 32GiB sector using different network scenarios and different sector compositions and durations. It doesn\u2019t account for deal payments, running costs, or token valuation at a later date.", "metadata": {}}}
