It was designed and operates as a pragmatic solution to the network's inability to otherwise prove useful storage in a verifiable, trustless, and incentive compatible way.\n* A version of **Filecoin Plus is needed** because without it, **storing data in deals is not the rational choice over committing capacity**. In essense, the program ensures self-interest aligns with storing data.", "metadata": {}}}
