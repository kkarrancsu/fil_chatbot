Understanding the solution space and making recommendations\n\n\nThis second portion of our research project is about understanding what can Filecoin proactively do, if net FVM gas demand turns out to reach a problematic regime.\n\n\n### Maintaining status quo\nThe main possible solution we will investigate is simply **maintaining status quo,** or not making any changes to the gas economic mechanisms. It could be argued that since FVM has the capacity to bring high levels of gas demand, as well as absorbing high levels of gas demand from Filecoin, in the free market these two forces might organically cancel each other. \n\nThe main argument against this free market approach is that there may be too much market inefficiency, inelasticity, and uncoordination.", "metadata": {}}}
