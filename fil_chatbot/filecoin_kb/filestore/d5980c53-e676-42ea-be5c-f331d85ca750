This means that each forecasting step corresponds to a day and the forecasted metrics correspond to the value we expect to see at the end of that day. We also assume that staking rewards and the decisions to stake or unstake occur once per day.\n- To avoid circular dependencies and simplify calculation, we assume that the Ecosystem Fund at step $t+1$ depends only on the tokens flows from step $t$. This is the same as saying that, in any given simulation step, tokens in the Ecosystem Fund are released before new tokens being locked. \n- All the new mechanisms and changes proposed in the tokenomics update are applied at the same time at the start of the simulation (day zero). This includes accelerated vesting, additional burning, the new fee models and the staking model.", "metadata": {}}}
