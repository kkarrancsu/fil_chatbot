We ran one simulation for each combination of exponents, with both $k_1$ and $k_2$ taking three possible values: 0.5, 1 and 2. Concretely, if $b_i$ is the total bandwidth operator $i$ served at given payout window and $s_i$ and $u_i$ are the operator's speed performance ratio and uptime, respectively, we define the scoring function for that operator as:\n\n$S_i= \\frac{b_i^{k_1} \\cdot s_i^{k_2} \\cdot u_i^{k_2}}{\\sum_{j=1}^n b_j^{k_1} \\cdot s_j^{k_2} \\cdot u_j^{k_2}}$", "metadata": {}}}
