In other words, assuming the token price stays stable on average throughout the simulation. Here, the factors that most impact profits are the staking sentiment (with higher TVL leading to higher total rewards and thus higher profits for the average validator) and the number of validators in the network (with more validators leading to lower profits per validator).\n\nIn the base token scenario, the majority of runs allow the average validator to generate a profit. When staking sentiment is at its lowest, the average profit drops to \\$9 per day, while the other two staking scenarios generate profits of around \\$300 per day.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"65%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r11bpest3.png\">\n\n**Figure 3.2.4:** Ecosystem fund balance by combined scenario\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
