Filecoin blocks can accommodate a finite amount of gas, a scarce resource, which has so far been used mostly only for processing storage-related messages.\n\nFVM will open the door to a variety of new uses for precious gas. There is a known risk of \"[gas gentrification](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/discussions/58)\". In that case the high demand from new FVM gas uses can price out storage providers, making storage-related messages too expensive, ultimately harming the foundation of the Filecoin network.", "metadata": {}}}
