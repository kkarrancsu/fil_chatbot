A token is only as valuable as the applications and services that it enables. Bitcoin (BTC) is a unique case because it is not just a digital asset, but also a neutral sovereign money that was designed to be inflation-proof and free from government influence.  Given its wide adoption since its inception, which was shortly after the 2008 financial crisis, network effects made it exceedingly difficult for another PoW cryptocurrency to replicate its success. The key reason might be that there's room for only one dominant economy for such a neutral sovereign money. The positive feedback loop of BTC\u2019s value increasing with its mass adoption very early on allowed it to be that dominant economy. To date, BTC continues to be one of the most successful crypto projects, and it is considered to be one of the most valuable digital currencies.", "metadata": {}}}
