Concretely, the introduction of the Staking Model will add locking and release dynamics that will depend on the sentiment of Stakers and Validators and network growth. \n\nIn addition, the two new Fee Models will introduce token burning that will depend on protocol fees (and thus protocol usage) and will introduce more locking and release dynamics that will be controlled by the payment of service fees into the Ecosystem Fund by Clients and the rewards released by the protocol to pay Validators and Stakers.", "metadata": {}}}
