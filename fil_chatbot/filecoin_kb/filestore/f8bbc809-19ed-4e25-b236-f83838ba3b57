Given this, we can quantify how this randomness trickles down into the target utility functions via Monte Carlo simulations. \n\n**Solution exploration and testing.** Given the first three modeling components mentioned above, one can then develop a set of testing scenarios that would, to some extent, approximate the behaviour of FVM demand, and its expected effect in the target function. Thus, we can start comparing some of the aforementioned proposed solutions, such as gas lanes, demand-driven pricing  (as proposed [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/587)), etc.", "metadata": {}}}
