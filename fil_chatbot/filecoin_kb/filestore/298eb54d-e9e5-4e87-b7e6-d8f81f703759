In other words, the collateral is only slashed if the operator decides to leave the network before the commitment is finished. This means that we can apply the same collateral to all operators as slashing is independent of the operators earnings.\n\nNote that the way penalties due to flags from the fraud detection system remain unchanged in this design. \n\nNext we will detail the mechanism for onboarding, slashing and termination/renewal.\n\n**Onboarding**\n\n1. Operator states their time commitment (with a certain minimum, to be defined).\n2. Operator sends the collateral amount to Saturn. The amount is fixed and does not depend on the expected earnings of the operator.\n3. Saturn checks when the collateral is sent. Once the collateral is confirmed, Saturn starts sending retrieval requests to the operator.\n\n**Slashing**", "metadata": {}}}
