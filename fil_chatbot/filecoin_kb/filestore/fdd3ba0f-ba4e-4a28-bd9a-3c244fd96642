This creates a demand for protocols that can facilitate the hedging of relative volatility between assets. The problem can be framed as one of designing a method to allow investors to earn high yields on nascent assets like FIL, while holding other valuable assets with strong downside protection.\n\nAn options contract that takes a deposit in a more mature asset like ETH, BTC, or USDC, converts it to Filecoin at market price, and sells the user an option to sell back the FIL at current market price solves this problem to an extent. However, this contract relies on someone taking the other side of the trade and assuming the Filecoin price risk, which may be difficult to find.\n\n## Insights", "metadata": {}}}
