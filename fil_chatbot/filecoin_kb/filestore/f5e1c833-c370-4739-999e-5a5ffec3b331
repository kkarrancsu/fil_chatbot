Thus, at any given time $t$, the total number of available tokens, $\\mathsf{Tokens_{available}}$, can be represented as:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\mathsf{Tokens_{available}}(t) = \\mathsf{StakingProgramSupportFund}\\left(1-e^{-\\mathsf{rate}\\times t}\\right) \\\\\n&+ r_\\text{max}\\left(b\\cdot \\min\\left(1,\\frac{\\mathsf{TVL}}{\\mathsf{TVL}_\\text{target}}\\right)^a+(1-b)\\min\\left(1,\\frac{N^\\text{val}}{N^\\text{val}_\\text{target}}\\right)^a\\right)\\mathsf{EcosystemFund}(t), \n\\end{aligned}", "metadata": {}}}
