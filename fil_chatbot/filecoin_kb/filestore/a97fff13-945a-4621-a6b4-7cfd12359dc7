Note that this ratio is defined as the total penalties received by an operator divided by the total rewards before penalties (which corresponds to the $1-\\tau$).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJOnbC57j.png)\n\nThe first takeaway is that even with a false positive rate of 1%, honest operators still experience penalties, which is expected. For the majority of honest nodes, when the multiplier is 5x, their penalties are lower than 20% of the rewards before penalties. With a multiplier of 7x, this ratio increases to 30%. In both cases, the median ratio is bellow 10%, which is the value set by upper bound assumption.", "metadata": {}}}
