Furthermore, it can be seen from such a figure that it is more likely to have a $\\tilde{G}_t$ close to 1 than to -1; meaning that gas tends to be over-used, rather than under-used. This is further evidenced in the top right figure, where we plot the histogram for $\\tilde{G}_t$. As we can see, the distribution for such a quantity seems to have a heavier right tail, as well as a non-negligible mass at $\\tilde{G}_t\\geq0.99$; in particular, it can be estimated (at 95\\% confidence) that\n \n \n | Quantity \t|  Estimated probability \t| 95% standard error\t|\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n| $\\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{G}_t\\geq0.99)$ \t|0.037 \t| 0.002 \t|\n|  $\\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{G}_t\\leq-0.60)$\t|0.016  \t|  0.002\t|", "metadata": {}}}
