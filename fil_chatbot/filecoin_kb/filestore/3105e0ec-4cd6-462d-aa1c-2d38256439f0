Our models predict that while minting rate will decrease, storage providers ROI is expected to remain stable following the baseline crossing from above.\n* The regulation of supply in response to changes in rawbyte storage growth is a unique adaptive feature of Filecoin\u2019s minting. The predicted crossing shows the mechanism is working as originally designed and ensures alignment between the network\u2019s growth targets and storage providers\u2019 block reward incentives.", "metadata": {}}}
