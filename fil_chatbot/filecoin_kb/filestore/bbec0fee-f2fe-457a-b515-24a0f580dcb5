These effects are, however, *short-lived* in the sense that once this value is above a certain threshold (about 0.05), its effects become negligible, as evidenced in the figure below. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkor_EjO2.png)\nA zoomed-in version of the previous figure is shown below.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1OZqu-K3.png)\n\n\nLastly, examining the effects of tipping rate on circulating supply, we see that they are relatively mild and only become more pronounced over time (see figure on the left). As we can see, increasing the tipping rate will, in turn, decrease the circulating supply over time. However, the rate of this change is relatively constant. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByKGitkKn.png)", "metadata": {}}}
