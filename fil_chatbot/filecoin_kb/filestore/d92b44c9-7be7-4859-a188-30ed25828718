This translates to consensus power on the parent chain+ block rewards from the parent chain.\n    - This effectively transforms FIL into a PoS chain? Could this deposit also be made instead in storage capacity? Or to implement a lending program where these staked FIL are to be used to subsidize storage providers.\n    - The initial deposit, must it always be in FIL? or can it be in the token of the parent chain? This means that only \u201cfirst layer\u201d subnets would need FIL deposits.\n- Role of FIL\n    - Each subnet may implement their own native token, which can be used for in-net transactions. These tokens cannot be sent to a different subnet, instead the native token must be translated to The parent-level token, and some of that parent token be transferred to a different subnet", "metadata": {}}}
