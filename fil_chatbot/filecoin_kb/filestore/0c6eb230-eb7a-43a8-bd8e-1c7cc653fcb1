Cianci, CryptoEconLab, July 2023\n\nIn this document, we detail the technical specifications of the model we used to tune and test Qredo's tokenomic redesign. The document has two main parts. \n\nFirst, we describe a mechanistic model, MechaQredo, that estimates a set of tokenomic metrics for the Qredo economy (e.g. circulating supply, Validator profit, Staker APR, etc.). The model receives two types of inputs, the tokenomic parameters we wish to tune and \"market\" inputs that encode user behavior, adoption and the current status of the network.\n\nThe second part is focused on the inputs to the mechanistic model. Particularly, we describe how we model and/or estimate the probabilistic inputs that encode user behavior and adoption and we detail the different scenarios that we will consider in the simulation. We also describe the parameters we are tuning and any constraints they may be subjected to.", "metadata": {}}}
