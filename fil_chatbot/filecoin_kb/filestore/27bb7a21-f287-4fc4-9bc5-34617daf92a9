As we can see, while the amount of blocks produced has stayed relatively constant for most of the year, there was a noticeable decrease in the number of blocks produced after April sixth, 2023. While this is not a helpful metric to understand the trends in base fees we have seen since mid-February, reducing the average number of produced blocks to 4 would represent a significant decrease in block space in the network. Indeed, while currently, the network should be able to accommodate an average of 72000 Billion gas units per day (at an average rate of 5 blocks per epoch), this change would reduce that block space by 20%, i.e., 57600 Billion gas units. There are better scenarios than this regarding gas gentrification since it would effectively mean that we have 20% less wiggle room to accommodate the demand for block space the network expects to bring.", "metadata": {}}}
