[Previously](https://www.notion.so/Duration-Changes-FIP-discussion-Analysis-Summary-735ce6685b7946f0a03fc13c3fe271fa) this was suggested to take a new value in the range 40-50%. Now we explicitly recommend 50%. This is needed to maintain the target in % available supply locked with lower slope duration multiplier.\n\n### What will the new ROI be?\n\nThe proposed changes intend to spread-out storage providers\u2019 return on investment to make it more sustainable, rather than high at the start then rapidly decreasing in the future. This is about making being an SP work long-term, and making sure the protocol is fair to those who are most long-term aligned.\n\nIn concrete terms, the modelled FIL-on-FIL annualized ROI for a 1 year sector with FIL+ sealed within the 1 year is expected to be around 50% with slope 1x and target multiplier 50%. This corresponds to the brown candle here:", "metadata": {}}}
