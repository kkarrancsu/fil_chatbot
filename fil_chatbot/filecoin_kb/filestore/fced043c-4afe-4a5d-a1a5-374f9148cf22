Fig. 4A shows the forecasted trajectories for total and simple minting trajectories. For each realization, we calculate the first date when the total block reward is within 2% of the block rewards due to simple minting. Fig. 4B shows a histogram of the crossing dates. These simulations show that if current onboarding and renewal rate trends continue, the median estimate when total minting approaches simple minting is on 2026-03-18, with quantiles Q5 and Q95 falling on 2024-12-01 and 2028-02-20, respectively.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1OG8ZiFh.png)\n\n*Fig 4: A) Minting forecasts and deterministic simple minting projection.
