Two possible indicators of this are large `gas_fee_caps` and large `miner tips` associated with FEVM-related messages. We plot the total daily `miner_tip` per method, the average daily `gas_fee_cap`, and the average daily `gas_premium` below.\n\n\nWe can see that, for the most part, the largest source of miner tips is due to `PublishSectorDeals`. Notably, right after FEVM launched, FEVM-related messages dominated the total daily tip amount, however this quantity rapidly decayed. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryNYgZDzn.png)", "metadata": {}}}
