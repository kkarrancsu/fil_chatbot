Indeed, since at each epoch a given amount of tokens are burnt, *ceterus paribus*, the circulating supply between any two epochs would decrease, thus making all other remaining tokens (slightly) more valuable.  The term in the parenthesis represents the amount by which the wealth has increased from token burning.", "metadata": {}}}
