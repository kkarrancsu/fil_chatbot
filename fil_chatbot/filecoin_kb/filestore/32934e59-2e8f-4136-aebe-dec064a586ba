When compared with ARWeave, Filecoin has, with conservative estimates accounting for FIL+ disputes, 3X the amount of \u201cuseful\u201d data. This data will then induce demand for value-add services to be built. Thus, amassing useful data storage on the network is a critical step in Filecoin\u2019s development. While imperfect, Fil+ has contributed significantly to onboard a significant amount of useful data. Improvements will only accelerate this trend and enable Filecoin to fulfill its mission.", "metadata": {}}}
