This figure includes both infrastructure and *human capital* expenses. However, a more sophisticated approach would be to collect a sample of different validators' monthly costs, estimate a distribution for this metric, and then sample from it on either a daily or monthly basis. This will yield a more robust and realistic portrayal of the validators' operating costs.\n\n\n\n#### Staking flows\n\nStaking flows encompasses two key inputs to MechaQredo, namely, the number of tokens locked and released by Stakers at each step $t$. Since the decisions to lock and release depend on many factors, we encode the possible actions of Stakers in a simplified framework that depends on the key tokenomic parameters that impact the Staking Model, and define some sensible scenarios for expressing the various decisions Stakers can make.", "metadata": {}}}
