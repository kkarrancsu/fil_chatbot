Introduction\nIn this document, we attempt to answer the following question: \n\nHow will the Filecoin Network respond to the power-loss scenario where a significant portion of SPs either: \n1. leave gracefully expiring power off the network\n2. terminate, causing a shock and a sudden loss of power to the network\n\nWe explore several variants of this scenario where different types of SPs (CC miners, Deal SPs, and Mixed SPs) leave or terminate the network at different proportions. Our initial findings indicate that there is a mechanism of the network that can enable it to recover from a network shock, provided that: a) FIL lending options such as Network Shortfall are in place for the recovery mechanism to be utilized, and b) that SPs recognize the economic incentives that manifest and take advantage of them.\n\nSupply dynamics and rewards distribution explain the network recovery mechanism. Let us examine the supply dynamics first.", "metadata": {}}}
