This measure indicates what happens to an output when you tweak a specific input while keeping everything else constant.\n- *Q2 - Sensitivity:* This measure identifies the rate of change of the output parameter concerning a specific input parameter. It shows how swiftly an output is changing relative to a specific input.\n\nTo estimate both measures, we ran multiples iterations of MechaQredo using the randomness provided by the base combined scenario. In other words, we assumed that token prices, staking sentiment and network usage followed their base scenarios.\n\n**Summary of findings**", "metadata": {}}}
