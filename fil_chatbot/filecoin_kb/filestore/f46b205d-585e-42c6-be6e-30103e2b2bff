Concretly, we are assuming that $\\delta^\\text{init} \\cdot \\tilde{S}^\\text{in}$ will be \ninstantaneously staked at day zero. We know that, most likely, wallet holders will take some time deciding they want to stake and then actually putting the request to stake. However, for simplicity, we will ignore this.\n\nAfter this first wave of staking, the simulation will enter a new phase in terms of Staker behavior. At the start of a given step $t>0$, all Stakers will have a certain amount of QRDO staked, $L_\\text{stake}(t-1)$. From this stake, they will be entitled to receive rewards, $R_{s}(t)$. After receiving rewards, they have to make two decisions:", "metadata": {}}}
