Given that the chain is currently working below capacity (i.e., at about 30% capacity), such a slight increase in gas usage is unlikely to cause any harmful increase (if any) in base fee$^*$. In particular, this additional requirement for gas can easily be absorbed by some of those blocks that are less than 3% below the target block size without any issue. \n2. **Slight increase in tokens burn.** The additional gas usage will, in turn, increase the number of tickets burnt, on average.\n3. **FVM considerations**. It is worth mentioning that while the increase in overall gas usage is estimated to be small, this increase can \"take away\" some space that could have otherwise been devoted to FVM.", "metadata": {}}}
