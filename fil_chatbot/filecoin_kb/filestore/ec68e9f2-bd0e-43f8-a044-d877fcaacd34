In contrast, a Layer 2 solution does not have its own consensus mechanism but instead relies on Ethereum security.   Roll ups are an example of a Layer 2 solution.\u00a0 Polygon (MATIC) and DFinity are examples of true side chains. \n\nSide chains have two main advantages. (1) they are permanent. Once a side chain is built, it is maintained and can be used by anyone off the main chain and (2) they allow interaction between different cryptocurrencies. However, miners are needed to ensure the safety of the side chains. This makes the formation of new sidechains costly. Sizable investments have to be made before any new sidechain can be created. Another downside to side chains is the requirement of a federation. The extra layer formed by the federation could prove to be a weak point for attackers.", "metadata": {}}}
