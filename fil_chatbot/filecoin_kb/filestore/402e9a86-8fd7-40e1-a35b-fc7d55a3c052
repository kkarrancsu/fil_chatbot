This leads to a bad incentive where operators are directly disadvantaged by having new operators join the network. \n\nOn the other hand, the growth pool does not suffer from this decay in rewards, with the average reward paid to each operator remaining fairly constant after the first days of the network's launch. For this reason, we propose the use of the growth reward pool mechanism over the constant reward pool. Thus, for the remaining analysis, we will focus on the results obtained using this strategy.", "metadata": {}}}
