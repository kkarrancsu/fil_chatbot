Indeed, the data above suggest that there **are a few** FEVM messages that are more price-inelastic than for the other methods; however, for the majority of the messages, this inelasticity does not hold true. \n\n\n### Conclusions \n\n\n\n\nThe average base fee increased after the FEVM launch, but there's no clear trend that suggests immediate risks of gentrification or sprawl. The network seems stable, but monitoring is required to draw more meaningful conclusions.\n\nGas usage distribution remained relatively stable and comparable to pre-launch levels, with no significant impact on network capacity or utilization.\n\nWhile a few FEVM messages had more significant miner tips, most were in line with other methods. There's no evidence of large-scale gas gentrification, but ongoing monitoring is necessary.", "metadata": {}}}
