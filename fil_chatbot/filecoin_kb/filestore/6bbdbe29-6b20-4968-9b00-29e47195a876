In particular, notice that if one were to fix such a quantity, while at the same time increasing $L_\\text{stake}(t)$, this would result in a lower APY for the returns (as the interest rate becomes smaller). Thus, as the TVL (in staking) increase, so should $R_s(t)$. Furthermore, making $R_s(t)$ increase faster than $L_\\text{stake}$ would create a sort of *positive sum game*, as in this case, everyone would benefit more from staking as TVL increases.\n\n\n## 2.
