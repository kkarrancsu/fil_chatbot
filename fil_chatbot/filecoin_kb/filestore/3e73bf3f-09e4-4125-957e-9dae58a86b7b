Furthermore,  in a general setting, one could consider updating the widths relative to their use. That is, if the block space used by messages of class $i$ is minimal compared to that of messages of class $j$, $j\\neq i$, the method would, algorithmically, re-allocate some of the (unused) spaced in category $i$ to category $j$. This width adjustment resembles the vault balancing process commonly found in (constant sum) Automated Market Makers (c.f.
