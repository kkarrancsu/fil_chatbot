The first is the *constant reward pool*, which is the simplest and most obvious way of splitting a pool of rewards through time. In particular, we picked the total pool (i.e. 120k FIL) and we divided it by the number of days we expected the pool to subside the network ($30 \\times 6$ months $= 180$ days), which results in constant daily pool of 667 FIL.\n\nThe second strategy is the *growth reward pool*, which aims to distribute rewards based on the network's growth. The idea is to have a baseline of network growth at each point in time (in this case, the total bandwidth delivered) and to increase the available pool of rewards as the network achieves the defined baseline.\n\nMore concretely, given the following variables:", "metadata": {}}}
