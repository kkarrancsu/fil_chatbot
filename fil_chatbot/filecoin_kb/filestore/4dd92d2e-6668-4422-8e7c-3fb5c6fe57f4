This can include the convenience of lower fees and faster transaction times, as well as access to new features and applications.\n- **Issuance (Optional)**: The ability to issue new tokens, which can be used to cover operator costs or to generate revenue for the rollup system as a whole.\n\nIt is essential for the system (in this case, the rollup) to maintain budget balance, meaning that they must receive a revenue equal to or greater than their costs. Generally, the mechanisms that dictate issuance in rollup systems are made dynamic in a way that can be used to ensure budget balancs. Operators can issue new tokens to cover their obligations if they are unprofitable.", "metadata": {}}}
