The rootnet has two levers to pull: it can control the amount of gas allocated to subnet checkpointing (making it cheaper or more expensive to checkpoint), and it could increase or decrease minimum collateral (making it a more or less enticing investment to spawn a first-layer subnet). \n\nThis is a lower level of control to the sharding case, where $N$ could be manually fixed. Nevertheless these are two powerful levers that could provide a major influence that propagates through the entire hierarchy. One could be reminded of a central bank raising or lowering interest rates, an effect that propagates to different levels of the national economy.", "metadata": {}}}
