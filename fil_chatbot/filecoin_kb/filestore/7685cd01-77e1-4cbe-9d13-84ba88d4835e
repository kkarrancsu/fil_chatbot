A final recommendation resulting from this research project would also involve a recommendation on the best possible mechanisms and parameters for a Block Balancer that maximizes the network target.\n\n\n\n\n## Work Plan and Milestones\n\nThis project is expected to be completed by the beginning of Q2 2023. It will also be the main project and occupy the majority of the resources of [AX](@7JfXCEujQwWCaFm8acpJ7A)  and [JP]( @-e2UbSEIRjClRu9Dz4XIQw  ) (CryptoEconLab) for this period.\n\n##### Week 1-2 (Jan 23- Feb 3)", "metadata": {}}}
