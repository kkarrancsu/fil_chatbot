At each epoch, the initial consensus pledge is calculated, and this depends on the circulating supply and quality adjusted power (QAP) \u2014 see [monies actor](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/blob/d56b240af24517443ce1f8abfbdab7cb22d331f1/actors/builtin/miner/monies.go#L170). With increased locking, the circulating supply numerator decreases and QAP denominator increases \u2014 this means the pledge decreases. This relationship in turn means the locked pledge **cannot** exceed the circulating supply. \n\nTo see how much is likely to be locked in typical scenarios please see the percentage available supply locked figure above.\n\n### *There is not enough FIL available to borrow/lend*", "metadata": {}}}
