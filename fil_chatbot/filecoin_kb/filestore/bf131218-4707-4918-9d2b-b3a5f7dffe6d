The target $B^T$ in EIP 1559 is set by engineering constraints, by what is the maximum block size that can be consistently processed. In this case, even if that is not infinite, but still much larger than the optimal  effective block size, $B^T\\gg B^*$, then the EIP 1559 mechanism will quickly decrease the base fee until it is close to zero.\n\nSince the target block size is hardwired into the EIP 1559 mechanism, the miners are not able to change this if it is too high, compared to current network demand, and it is far from the optimal block size for maximizing their utility. \n\nIf EIP 1559 is meant to emulate and improve upon first price auction dynamics, then it must have a mechanism to adjust the target block size, according to demand, specially when the demand is consistently lower than the block capacity. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Adjusting EIP 1559 target", "metadata": {}}}
