As we can see, the plots looks quite similar for higher values of $\\alpha$; this is natural, since, regardless of the proportion of FVM messages, the miner at hand will always pack all the SP messages first, which account for a maximum block space of about $0.7B_\\text{target}$, leaving at most $0.3B_\\text{target}$ worth of block space available, irrespective of $\\alpha$. In a practical setting, this would imply that FVM users will likely need to wait a comparatively longer time to get their messages included.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ7dLra13.png)\n\n\n**Gas usage**\n\nIf we had the goal of maximizing total network revenue, from our previous results, it is possible to infer what should be the optimal block size to fill, for a given level of demand.", "metadata": {}}}
