Once Saturn begins to onboard content publishers to the network (which will be paying for the service), we can use logs submitted by these clients to cross-check the logs provided by node operators. None of the sides have incentives to collude in cheating the network because one of the sides will always pay to the rewards of the other side. However, this approach will not be available in the first version of the system because Saturn does not yet have clients.\n\n:::warning\n:warning: Can we think of other ways of doing such cross-checks?\n:::\n\n## Heuristics\n\nHeuristics are defined as simple rules that encode a specific behavior we are trying to avoid. In this module, we will have heuristics for the two levels described before - requests and operators.", "metadata": {}}}
