If the blockchain can only process a block size $B^T$, but the optimal effective block size is larger, $B^*>B^T$, then miners would still use the full capacity of the blockchain. This is why the issues we are discussing here have not been relevant to Bitcoin or Ethereum, since there is typically much more demand to use the block space than they can handle.\n\n### EIP 1559 induced deviation from free-market behavior", "metadata": {}}}
