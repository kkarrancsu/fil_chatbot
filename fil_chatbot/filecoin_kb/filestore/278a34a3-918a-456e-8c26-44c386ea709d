An attacker can hurt the network in two ways by submitting too many of these transactions:\n\nThey can spam the network and block all other users that want to submit transactions\nThey can drain the Ecosystem fund, thus blocking all other users to submit protocol-funded transactions until service fees are collected and paid into the fund.\nNote that none of these attacks lead to financial gain for the attacker, but they can cause real harm to the network.\n\nThere are some ways to mitigate this issue. First, we need to differentiate which transactions can be submitted by protocol users and which transactions can only be generated by the protocol. The protocol-only transactions are not an issue since attackers cannot submit them.", "metadata": {}}}
