To that end, we perform a similar analysis to one above. As we will see, these two SPs increased FIL spending in the last few months. In general, this increase can be  either:\n\n- *Network-driven*, such as more volatile base fees and increased gas usage for `PublishStorageDeals,` as discussed above, or they can also be \n- *SP-driven*, which reflects changes in a specific SPs consumption due to, e.g., increased data onboarding. \n\nIn what follows, we focus on the specific gas consumption of these two SPs, intending to improve our understanding of these SP-driven factors. \n\n\n**SP A**", "metadata": {}}}
