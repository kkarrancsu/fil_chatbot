Counterfactual scenario where raw byte onboarding power, sector renewal rate, and FIL+ reach target values in 180 days. Future trajectories for Filecoin macro and SP econometrics depend on raw byte onboarding and renewal rates. These are treated as assumptions, chosen to span 0% (purple) to 100% (green) of the historical maximums. The power assumptions used to drive the simulation (bottom two panels), have color coding that matches the top 4 panels for Network Raw Byte Power, Initial Pledge, Minting Rate and 1y ROI (pre gas and other costs).*\n\nFig. 7 shows the case where sector renewal rate exponentially grows or decays to a defined percentage of their historical maximum (ranging from 10% to 90%) 180 days after simulation start. FIL+ rate and onboarding power reach a target value equal to their historical median in 180 days. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1-TAWrdi.png)", "metadata": {}}}
