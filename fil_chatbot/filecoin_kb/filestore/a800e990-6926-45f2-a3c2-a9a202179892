Now, we have two options in case slashing:\n1. We stop requests until the operator adds more funds to their collateral balance to make up for the loss. This is the safest approach, but it has two main drawbacks, namely, it will impact service since requests need to be routed to other operators, and it will penalize even more the honest operators that are flagged by the log detection system (we always expect some level of False Positives).\n2. We use the future rewards to replenish the collateral balance, but we continue to send requests to the operator. This is less penalizing for honest nodes, but it may be a problem for misbehaving nodes that are not fulfilling a good level of service.\n\n:::warning\n:warning: what is the best approach for replenishing collateral after slashing?
