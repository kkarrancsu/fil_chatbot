This score function, in turn, should depend on whether a FPoS or DPoS mechanism is in place, the amount staked by a specific validator, reputation, etc. For example, in the initial stages where an FPoS system is in place, this score function could split these rewards equally among the number of Nodes (since there is no need for them to stake capital). For a DPoS system, this function should give a more significant *portion of the pie* to those validators with larger stakes and higher reputation scores.", "metadata": {}}}
