Cianci, CryptoEconLab, July 2023\n\nIn this report, we analyze the current token allocation for QRDO and its current circulating supply dynamics.\n\nIn addition, we specify the allocation the 1B QRDO not yet allocated and explore how the new tokenomic mechanisms being introduced (i.e. the Staking Models and the new Fee Models) will impact the dynamics of the QRDO supply.\n\n## QRDO allocation\n\n### Current allocation\n\nWhen the QRDO token was launched, its total token supply was set at 2 billion. At the time, 1 billion was allocated, while the remaining 1 billion was set apart for future allocations. Since the second billion is not yet allocated, the \"available\" total supply of QRDO does not include these tokens. The next plots shows the token allocation over this \"available\" total supply.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"420\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkjo24yw2.png\">\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
