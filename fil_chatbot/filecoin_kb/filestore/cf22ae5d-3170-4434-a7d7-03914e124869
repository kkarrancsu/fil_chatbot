On the $x$ axis we would have the net FVM gas demand, which could be positive or negative. For certain, mapped against its expected effect on the given target function on the $y$ axis. Such a graph can be generated for each of the proposed target functions above. In general for a given target, net FVM gas demand being too large either in a positive or a negative direction, would be harmful to the target, as is illustrated in this hypothetical example. There could be some optimal point in the graph where the target function is maximized. \n\nObtaining or estimating such plots will require developing innovative mathematical analysis and complex system simulation techniques. \n\n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkcqELOos.png)", "metadata": {}}}
