The trends are almost identical to Case 2, where there is no gas burn due to $\\mathtt{basefee}$. From a supply perspective, this makes sense b/c burn due to $\\mathtt{basefee}$ is a small percentage of circulating supply.\n\n![case3a](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ1Xm9HUp.png)\n\n*Fig 5: Changes to the supply statistics in Case 3.*\n\n## Monetary Considerations of DDO\nIn this section, we estimate the additional investment needed to fully utilize the chain through power onboarding. More precisely, we aim to answer the question: what does the power onboarding rate need to be, such that the same amount of gas is used for onboarding as it was previously?", "metadata": {}}}
