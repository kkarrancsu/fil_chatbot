On average, this utilizes about 19% of the gas for any given block. Similarly, as with the previous two messages, this message was included in all examined blocks, and the distribution for the gas it consumes is also left-skewed. As it can be seen from the ACF plot in the bottom right, the ACF decays to zero at almost lag-1. This can be roughly interpreted as every realization of the gas used by `SubmitWindowedPost` being statistically independent of each other. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/83E71kW.png)\n\nWe now focus on `ProveCommitAggregate`. Contrary to the previous three messages, this method is not present in every block, as it can be seen from the histogram between non-zero times. Such a message is included, on average, every 3 blocks. As we can see, the distribution of the gas usage of such a method can be well-approximated by an exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda=2.68\\times10^{-9}$.", "metadata": {}}}
