Here, we focused on key metrics that allowed us to assess how the new design would impact the sustainability of the network and the utility of the token.\n\nWe conducted a simulation for 3 years, using the same scenarios as before (token price, network usage, and staking sentiment). The tokenomic parameters we employed are as follows:", "metadata": {}}}
