In the \u2018all sectors\u2019 scenario, if a large proportion of SPs providing CC power extend on the same day, this could lead to future jumps in power and locked supply. A schematic illustrating synchronisation of power that can potentially lead to future jumps is shown in Figure 2. A similar shock can occur in the \u2018new sectors\u2019 scenario if SPs terminate and re-onboard CC power in a coordinated fashion.  The macro effects to Filecoin\u2019s economy in these cases are illustrated in the jump scenarios in Figure 1 (red and purple).\n\nThe jump scenarios are not expected to be detrimental to the network for the following reasons:", "metadata": {}}}
