As can be seen from the figure below, this message was included in all examined blocks. Notice that this should not be a surprising fact, given how Filecoin operates (and the same holds true for `PreCommitSector` and `SubmitWindowedPost`). Notice, furthermore,the distribution for the gas it consumes is left-skewed. As it can be seen from the ACF plot in the bottom right, the ACF decays to zero at around lag 10. This can be roughly interpreted as it taking 5 blocks for any two values of gas usage by this method to become statistically independent. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/hRgO3iN.png)", "metadata": {}}}
