Each block has a maximum block space of $10^{10}$ gas units. On any given day there are, on average $N_s=14400$ different blocks: \n\n$$N_\\text{blocks}=\\underbrace{2880}_{\\text{epochs in a day}}\\times \\underbrace{5}_\\text{avg. No of blocks per epoch}=14400.$$\n\nThus, the average daily available block space is then $$A=10^{10}\\times N_\\text{blocks}= 1.44\\times 10^{14}.$$\n\nTaking the ratio between $U$ and $A$ then implies that the network is running at roughly 32% capacity. In particular, this means that the network could, in theory, accommodate an additional 18% of capacity (on average) without surprising the target block utilization. Thus, **we do not expect this FIP to cause any significant congestion** (due to block space). In particular, **we do not expect that such a small increase in gas usage would cause any harmful change (if any at all) in the statistical properties of the base fee**. By these we mean drift, volatility, etc.", "metadata": {}}}
