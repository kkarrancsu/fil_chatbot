In addition, 3-year sectors have higher total returns than 1-year sectors. This is the exact behavior we were hoping for with the introduction of the duration multipliers.\n\nHowever, if we look at the annualized return, 1-year sectors seem more advantageous during the first 2 years.  Nevertheless, rate at which annualized return is decreasing in time is much slower in the 3-year sectors and on the 1-year sectors, meaning at, in the long run, longer sectors will become more advantageous.\n\nThus, in conclusion, in the long run, if SPs behave rationally and if we disregard the additional operational costs and cash availability, SPs are incentivized to continue to lock more FIL+ deals and to do it in longer sectors.\n\n\n#### Impact of different scenarios on FoFR", "metadata": {}}}
