The Fil+ multiplier change is shown in Fig 1b. Here, we observe that:\n* NetworkQAP exhibits a declining trend across all onboarding scenarios, due to the reduced QA multiplier. However, QAP is higher than the 1x scenario (**Option 1**).\n* Network locked follows a similar trend, and this follows from the reduced collateral requirements from decreasing Network QAP.\n* The FoFR with costs decline is more drawn out but exhibits sharp drops which accompany the Fil+ multiplier changes. This follows from the reduced cost dilution each time the QA multiplier is reduced. The intensity and dynamics of the FoFR with costs decline is sensitive to SP costs and network power dynamics.", "metadata": {}}}
