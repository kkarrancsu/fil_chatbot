This was a major milestone for Filecoin (more info here). Since then, the network has been minting tokens at full speed since the network has managed to maintain a high growth rate. However, current market conditions (e.g. China\u2019s crackdown, crypto market crash, etc.) are putting pressure on the Storage Providers (SPs) and their growth capability.\n\n## Goals and Milestones\n\nThe goal of this project is to investigate this problem and understand the potential consequences of the network experiencing a downward baseline crossing. In particular, we will estimate the likelihood of observing a baseline crossing assuming current market conditions, we will model the consequences of that event for both SPs and the network as a whole, and we will look into potential mitigation strategies.\n\nThe work is divided into 4 main milestones:", "metadata": {}}}
