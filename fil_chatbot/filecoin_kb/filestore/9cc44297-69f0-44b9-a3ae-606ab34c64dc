Instead, the Boba Network lives\u00a0*inside* of Ethereum as a series of smart contracts that are capable of executing Ethereum transactions. Whereas side chains rely on their own consensus mechanisms for security, Boba relies on the security of Ethereum itself.\n\n***Polygon Nightfall***\n\nNightfall (currently running in testate) is designed to lower the transaction cost of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 token private transfers. Interestingly, Nightfall uses an optimistic rollup for lowering the costs and the privacy is attained by leveraging zero knowledge proofs.  Validators will roll up transactions into blocks and submit them to the Optimistic contracts. Challengers will submit fraud proofs for any invalid block to the same contracts.  Like Boba, liquidity providers enable instant withdrawal of fungible tokens.\n\n### ZK Rollup Details", "metadata": {}}}
