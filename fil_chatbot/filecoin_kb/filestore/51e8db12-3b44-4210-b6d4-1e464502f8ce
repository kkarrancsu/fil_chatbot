Instead, a simulation tool that demonstrates the performance of the proposed system under various network conditions could be a more feasible goal. This tool could simulate the behaviour of transactions under different gas prices and congestion levels, demonstrating how the system prioritizes transactions and reduces congestion.\n\n3. **Smart Contract Templates:**\n\n    Students could develop a set of smart contract templates that demonstrate how transactions might be created and managed under the proposed system. These templates could include features like setting the gas price for different lanes and handling lane assignments.\n\n4. **Presentation and Demonstration:**", "metadata": {}}}
