The idea here is to introduce a factor $p_{\\ell,t}$ that takes values between 0 and 1 and which gives the proportion of the block space allocated to lane $\\ell$ at epoch $t$. Thus, if $p_{\\ell,t}=0.5$, for example, it means that lanel $\\ell$ has 50% of the target block space; if $p_{\\ell,t}=0.25$ it means that lane $\\ell$ has 25% of the block space, etc. \n</p>\n</p></span>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
