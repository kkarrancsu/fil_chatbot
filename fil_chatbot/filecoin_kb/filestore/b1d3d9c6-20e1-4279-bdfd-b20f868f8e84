A counter-factual comparison on Storage Mining Rewards according to distinct scenarios (red: what if baseline was not activated, green: what if RBP is always equal to baseline). The Higher the Mining Utility, the more FIL-on-FIL profitable it is to participate on the network. Baseline Minting essentialy creates a Macro \"savings account\" for the future without reducing the individual rewards.

The network disburses maximum rewards when network RBP exceeds the baseline storage target, a key performance indicator (KPI). The baseline storage capacity is currently targeted to double network storage capacity annually.", "metadata": {}}}
