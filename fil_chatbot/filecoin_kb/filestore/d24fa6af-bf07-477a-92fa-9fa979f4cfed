The perspective is our own - that is, of an ecosystem participant, engaged, motivated, closely familiar with the economic mechanisms of Filecoin, and a vested interest in the long term success of the network. \n\nAs with any perspective, it is one view. Others\u2019 views will differ. Ecosystems are by definition complex and diverse and Filecoin\u2019s is not an exception, so we don\u2019t expect the nuanced questions that arise, relying on deep knowledge, specialized experience or the like, to have singular answers. Still, our capacity to make meaningful steps forward consistently, depends on us jointly on having high-value information and this being widely available and understood, which motivates us to present our perspective as one input.", "metadata": {}}}
