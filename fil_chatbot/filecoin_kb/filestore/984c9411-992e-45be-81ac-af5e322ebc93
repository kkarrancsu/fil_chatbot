If we chose the number of requests, we would be indirectly considering network usage in this incentive. Two node operators with speeds always bellow the thresholds would receive different rewards solely based on the number of requests they served.\n\n\n#### Uptime scoring function\n\nWe currently have a table called `health_check_failures` that stores data on \"downtime\" events from nodes. Every minute, the orchestrator sends a health check to every node and stores the results. Nodes that fail the health check are logged to the `health_check_failures` table. \n\nWe can get an estimate of downtime from this information. The proposal is to compute the percentage of health check failures per given amount of time. Let $d_i$ represent the health check failure percentage for node $i$. We define $u_i = 1 - d_i$ as the uptime estimate for node $i$.", "metadata": {}}}
