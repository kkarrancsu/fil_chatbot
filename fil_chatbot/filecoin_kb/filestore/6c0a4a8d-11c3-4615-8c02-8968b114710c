This means that when a known active sector renews, we assume that its percentage of Fil+ will also change to match these two parameters.\n* The quality multiplier for new onboards will depend on the rate of Fil+ deals ($\\textrm{fil_plus_rate}$), the sector duration ($d$), the multiplier for Fil+ deals ($m_{Fil+}$), and the duration multiplier function ($m_{dur}(d)$), which depends on the sector duration $d$.\n* The duration multiplier function is a user input and will be one of the parameters to tune during our simulations", "metadata": {}}}
