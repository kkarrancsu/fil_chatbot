Longer durations receive a higher rate of rewards, and longer durations also lock more collateral.\n- Adapt the InitialPledgeLockTarget parameter so the total value locked tracks on a higher long-term trajectory. This increases stability which is necessary for successful SP businesses and long-term storage goals.\n- Collectively these actions incentivize long-term storage and improve the long-term outlook of the network.\n\n### Revised parameters\n\nAfter consulting Storage Providers and the broader community we suggest adapting the [previous proposal](https://www.notion.so/Duration-Changes-FIP-discussion-Analysis-Summary-735ce6685b7946f0a03fc13c3fe271fa) in two ways.\n\n**The first change** is to decrease slope from **2x** to **1x.**", "metadata": {}}}
