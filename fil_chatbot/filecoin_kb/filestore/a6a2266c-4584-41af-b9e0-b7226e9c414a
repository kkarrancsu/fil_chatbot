We argue that the current EIP 1559 formulation works as intended when block space is in very high demand, however in low demand periods the block usage dynamics would deviate from what rational miners would do in a first price auction mechanism. Our proposal addresses this issue by adjusting the target block size by maximizing a target function that can be chosen to maximize miner utility.\n## Introduction\n\nIn this document we provide motivation and possible mechanisms for introducing a variable target block size for the EIP 1559 mechanism, which is currently used to set the base fee in Filecoin.\n\nLet $r_t$ denote the base fee at a given time $t$. Time $t$ here is to be understood as a discrete variable, synonymous with block epoch.", "metadata": {}}}
