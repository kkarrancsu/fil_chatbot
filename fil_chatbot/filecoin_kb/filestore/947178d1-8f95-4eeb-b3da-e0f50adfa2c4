This delta is simple terms the total inflows at step $t$ (i.e. the new locked pledge) minus the total outflows at step $t$ (i.e. the pledge release):\n\n$$\\Delta pledgeL(t) = Pl_t - releasePl_t$$\n\n\nBefore going into detail about the inflows and outflows, we need to clarify how pledge works for two different types of sectors, namely, newly onboarded sectors and renewed sectors.\n\nWhen a sector is onboarded, its pledge is computed and locked until the time when the sector is expected to expire (assuming there is no early termination). At that time, the sector may have two outcomes - expiration or extension.", "metadata": {}}}
