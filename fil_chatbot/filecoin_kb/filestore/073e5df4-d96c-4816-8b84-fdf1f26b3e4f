In order to so, we will rely upon several approximations.  While these approximations will not always hold in practice, we use them as a first-step towards understanding the task at hand. In upcoming work, we will investigate this issue through the lens of Agent-Based Models, which can in turn helps broaden our understanding of the tasks at hand, while at the same time relying upon a smaller number of assumptions, that we present next.", "metadata": {}}}
