This is because the proportion of gas consumed by FEVM-related messages in the average block is relatively small compared to other messages. \n\nIndeed, in most epochs, FEVM gas usage has remained relatively small, with a few moments as an exception where such gas usage exceeded 2B gas units. It is worth mentioning that the first spike in FEVM gas used likely corresponds to the FEVM launch, where many contracts were deployed.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkT-4WvGh.png)\n\n\n\nIn any case, the daily gas usage by FEVM-related messages has remained quite small since the launch, as evidenced by the figures below.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryqEx-wM2.png)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ_rl-wz3.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Gentrification", "metadata": {}}}
