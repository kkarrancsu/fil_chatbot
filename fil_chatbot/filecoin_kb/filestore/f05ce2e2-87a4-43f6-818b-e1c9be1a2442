These are the schedules of the first 1B tokens allocated back in 2021 and which we cannot change. In particular, this group includes the allocations to the team, treasury fund, advisors, option holders, seed round investors, and private sales.\n- New Vesting Schedules, resulting in a vesting function $V_\\text{new}(t)$. These are the schedules that will be defined in this tokenomics update. Concretely, this includes the entire second billion tokens not yet allocated and the updated schedules from the Ecosystem fund (which is in scope of being reviewed).", "metadata": {}}}
