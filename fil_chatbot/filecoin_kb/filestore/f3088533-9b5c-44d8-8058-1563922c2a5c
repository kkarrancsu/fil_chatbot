This means that each forecasting step corresponds to a day and the forecasted power metrics correspond to the value we expect to see at the end of that day.\n* We use the current sector states (i.e. known schedule expirations) and we estimate future onboardings and future renewals.\n* The daily power onboarded is a constant provided as a tunable parameter. This is a BIG assumption and we will probably want to make the new onboarding a function of time (e.g. have a linear function or a capped liner function). However, for this first deterministic model, having a constant is the easiest approach.\n* The sector renewal rate is a constant provided as a tunable parameter.\n* Sector durations are constants provided as a tunable parameter.", "metadata": {}}}
