In this setting, each lane would be intended for a specific type of message, such as, e.g., network-related maintenace messages, data onboarding, or FVM-related messages, and each type of message will be priced according to the resources consumed in each lane.  \n\nWe present two examples to illustrate the point. We emphasize that the values taken in those examples are purely chosen for illustration purposes, and are not to be understood as a specific recommendation. \n \n ---\n**Example I.**\n\nLet's say that we introduce two gas lanes:", "metadata": {}}}
