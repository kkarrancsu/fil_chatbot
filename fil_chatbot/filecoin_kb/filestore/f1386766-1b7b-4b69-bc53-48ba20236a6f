Input configuration to mechaFIL that is used for various scans when testing the investment conserved regime when both RBP and RR are scaled by the SDM multiplier. D) shows the various SDM slopes that are considered.*\n\nUnder current trends of raw-byte onboarding rate, renewal rate, and FIL+ rate, we observe that in the data onboarding conserved scenarios, network RBP (Fig. 1A) is maintained at current levels; variations are due to differences in sector durations that are simulated. Because RBP is maintained, minting stays the same across all data onboarding conserved scenarios (Fig. 1C). Under the investment conserved scenarios, represented by the solid lines, we observe a dip in network RBP. This necessarily follows from the investment conservation thesis, and results in reduced minting as a direct consequence of reduced network RBP.", "metadata": {}}}
