From here, it continues to grow for the following 2 years. Supply growth rates decelerate significantly in all scenarios at the start of 2026. This is the time when legacy vesting schedules finish.\n\nIn all scenarios, daily inflation rates are lower than 0.9%, which is below the 1.5% currently experienced by the network. \n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BksjM9qt2.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJb2f59Y2.png\">\n<img width=\"65%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1xOhz55K3.png\">\n\n**Figure 3.1.2:** Components of circulating supply by combined scenario - average across runs\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
