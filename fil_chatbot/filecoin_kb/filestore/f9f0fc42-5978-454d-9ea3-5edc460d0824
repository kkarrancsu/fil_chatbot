In other words, the drop in rewards a node gets by a bad performance in speed and/or uptime is much lower with the linear functions than the direct multiplication functions. The effect is most accentuated in the all supra-linear scoring function, which a lower performance in either download speed or uptime leading to a significant decrease in rewards.", "metadata": {}}}
