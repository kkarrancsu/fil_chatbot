At the time sectors are expected to expire, a percentage of these sectors will renew. Thus, we estimate renewals simply as the product between the renewal rate and the scheduled expirations:\n\n$$R_{t}^{RB} = r_t \\cdot SE_{t}^{RB} $$\n\nThe renewal rate is user-defined paramater and is a constant ($r_t = \\textrm{renewal_rate}$).\n\n\n## Quality-adjusted power\n\nThe equations for QA power are almost the same as the the ones for RB power, where one can simply exchange the $RB$ by $QA$. There are however two differences.\n\nFirstly, the new onboarded power needs to be adapted to take into account the Fil+ multiplier and the rate of Fil+ deals (where $\\gamma = \\textrm{fil_plus_rate}$):", "metadata": {}}}
