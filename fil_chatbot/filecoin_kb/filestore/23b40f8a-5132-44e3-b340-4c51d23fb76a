In other words, a lower $k_1$ will distribute rewards more evenly in regard to the bandwidth served, while a high $k_1$ will overcompensate operators serving more bandwidth than the \"average\" operator.\n\nAs for the $k_2$ exponent, it controls how severely underperformance in either uptime of download speed is penalized. A high $k_2$ exponent leads to large drops of reward when uptime or the speed performance ratio fall below 100%.  On the other hand, a low $k_2$ exponent will make those drops smoother and the rewards in case of underperformance slightly higher.", "metadata": {}}}
