However, in order for the incentive to be effective, penalties need to be large enough to make the risk of detection unprofitable. In other words, the expected reward of submitting fake/altered logs should be lower than the expected reward of being honest, taking into account the probability of detection. This is one of the metrics we will model when testing different reward mechanisms in the simulation (more details in the next section).\n\nIndependently of the penalty amounts and tuning required, we can think of four main penalty mechanisms, each with an increasing scope of punishment:", "metadata": {}}}
