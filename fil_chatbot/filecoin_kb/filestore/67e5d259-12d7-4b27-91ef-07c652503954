This is a potential rational action, due to the sudden drop in FoFR after the policy is implemented, as shown in Fig 2. above. To simulate this, we simulate onboarding trajectories where the raw-byte power onboarded per day is linearly increased from its starting value to a certain percentage of the steady-state value until the policy update date. This is indicated by the RampUp percentage value in Fig 3. Note that a RampUp=0.00% is not equivalent to the main set of simulations, which use MCMC forecasting for the RBP trajectory until the policy update date. We then exponentially decrease the onboarding rate from the policy update date to a steady-state value in 90 days, simulating a return back to steady-state.", "metadata": {}}}
