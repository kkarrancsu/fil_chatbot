The states are the **Data Onboarding Conservation** regime and the **Investment Conservation** regime. \n\nThe **Data Onboarding Conservation** regime is the scenario where data onboarding follows the current trend. If average duration increases, network QAP and locking also increase.\n\nIn the **Investment Conservation** regime, the amount of investment flowing into the economy is fixed. In this case, if average duration increases, onboarding and renewal rate must decrease. This is because pledge increases proportional to network QAP and a duration multiplier increases network QAP.", "metadata": {}}}
