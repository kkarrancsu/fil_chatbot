Thus,  we use linear least squares to find out the parameters that make up such a relationship. This doesn't mean that daily gas usage can be predicted from netwrok RBP with 100% accuracy, but as show in the figure below, these quantities are, in fact, related.\n</p>\n</p></span>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
