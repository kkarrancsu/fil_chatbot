We observe that in the initial term,  Thing 1 will yield lower circulating supply relative to the base case, especially in high shortfall effectiveness regimes, relative to Thing 2. This is largely due to the difference in how the Thing 1 and Thing 2 variants handle shortfall repayment. In the Thing 1 iteration, a large portion of block rewards will be diverted in to a Storage Provider's locked balance over the sector's lifetime in order to cover shortfall, whilst a small fraction is burnt as a \"protocol fee\"; in the Thing 2 iteration, a portion of rewards are simply burnt until shortfall is repaid. However, over time, the FIL locked to cover repayments in the Thing 1 policy variant is eventually \"unlocked\" and reenters supply, resulting in the corresponding increase in supply relative to the base case shown above. The Thing 2 policy will yield the opposite result; since", "metadata": {}}}
