Side chains require their own miners. Miners can be given incentives through merged mining, where two different cryptocurrencies with the same algorithm are mined at the same time.\n\n### Typical Costs of Scaling Solutions\n\nScaling solutions typically have three types of costs: L1 data publication fee, L2 cost of operations,  and L2 congestion costs. \n\nA system receives revenue in two forms: transaction value and issuance.\n\n- **User fee**\u00a0= L1 data publication fee + L2 operator fee + L2 congestion fee\n- **Operator cost**\u00a0= L2 operator cost + L1 data publication cost\n- **Operator revenue =**\u00a0User fees + MEV\n- **Operator profit = Operator revenue - Operator cost**\u00a0= L2 congestion fee + MEV", "metadata": {}}}
