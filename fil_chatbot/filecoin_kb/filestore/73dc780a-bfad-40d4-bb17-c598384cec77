To do this, we overestimate the amount of gas required by M&O messages. However, this can cause the opposite effect: having too much space for M&O messages will in turn mean that the base fee for such a lane will tend to go down. This is not necesarilly ideal from a token-burning perspective, however, we choose to do it in such a way since:\n    \n1.  it  errs on the side of caution by giving these network-critical messages (more than) sufficient space. \n2.   The scenario which this aims to avoid, i.e., one where demand for FEVM-related messages is so large it *blocks* M&O messages from being included, would likely \"make up\" for this lost of tokens burned.", "metadata": {}}}
