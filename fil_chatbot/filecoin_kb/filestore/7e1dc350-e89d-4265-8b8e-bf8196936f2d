The \u2018all sectors\u2019 choice distinguishes accessibility but may better support the raw byte network than \u2018new sectors\u2019 choice. The importance of this is encoded in the baseline storage target function. Its maintenance should be viewed in cooperative rather than zero-sum competition terms. This is expressed through increases in baseline minting that can occur with increases in raw byte power. \n\n**Incentives to terminate early**\n\nIf power increases through introduction of SDM this can change Initial Pledges and potentially create incentives to terminate and re-onboard compared to maintaining a sector.\n\nThis can arise across each of the 4 simulated macro scenarios under certain specific conditions.  For example, it can occur for an individual sector with a 1 year commitment if the average network duration quickly increases due QAP growth leading to decreased Initial Pledge. See Figure 3 for an example.", "metadata": {}}}
