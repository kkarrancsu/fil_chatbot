While this *might* suggest gentrification, it is important to remember that (i) at the time of writing, FEVM-releated messages only make up a rather small proportion of all messages, and that (ii) this is a tip per gas unit. Once again, we see that this amount decayed rapidly after launch. \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkOwxWwf3.png)\n\n\nInterestingly enough, the largest gas fee cap has been almost always associated with `SubmitWindowedPost` messages; this is not too surprising since, intuitively, miners are more motivated to submit these messages as soon as they can. It is also notable that FEVM-related messages tend to have some of the smallest `gas_fee_caps`. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryfsl-vM2.png)", "metadata": {}}}
