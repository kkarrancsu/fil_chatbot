It means that parties are committing raw resources (both capital and hardware) to the network, as well as storage capabilities. We look to simulate and examine a range of potential network behaviors that might arise as a result of the shortfall policy. In particular, we simulate the impact on Filecoin circulating supply dynamics potential changes in storage onboarding behavior. \n\nAs introduced in the \"[Impact on Storage Onboarding Potential](https://hackmd.io/xElv2TQXRjuiSmFnY7HLJQ?both#Impact-on-Storage-Onboarding-Potential)\" section, we sweep across low, medium, and high base scenarios for storage power onboarding as well as adoption (or \"effectiveness\") of the shortfall policy for each variant of the shortfall policy (Thing 1 and Thing 2).", "metadata": {}}}
