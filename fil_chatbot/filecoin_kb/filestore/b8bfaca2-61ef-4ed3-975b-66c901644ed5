This is the percentage of power that will renew at $t$ out of all the power scheduled to expire at $t$\n* $d$: duration of a sector after onboarding or renewal\n\nNote that all RB notations have an equivalent notation in QA. As an example, the $P_t^{QA}$ is defined to be the total QA power at step $t$.\n\n\n## Raw-byte power\n\nWe define the RB power at a given step as the previously observed RB adjusted for the inflows and outflows expected at the current step. The inflows are the new onboards and the renewals, while the outflows are the scheduled expirations:", "metadata": {}}}
