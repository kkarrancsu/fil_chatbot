For instance, higher network usage and lower token prices will lead to higher APR for the same TVL rate. We will come back to this feature in the next subsection.\n\nNow, looking that daily validator profits, we see a big difference between the various scenarios. This was expected as we are using the token price to convert the average validator rewards into USD. The optimistic combined scenario results in a consistent daily average profit of around \\$1900. On the other hand, the base combined scenario starts with an average profit of \\$2344 per day and, after 3 years, decreases to an average of \\$236 per day. Finally, the pessimistic scenario starts with a daily profit of \\$2070 and finishes with a loss of \\$152 per day.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJrc66qKn.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyHLaaqKn.png\">", "metadata": {}}}
