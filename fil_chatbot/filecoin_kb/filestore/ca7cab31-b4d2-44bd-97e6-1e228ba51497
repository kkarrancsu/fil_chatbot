We remark that this approach would require a significant time commitment and as such, we choose not to pursue it in this particular report. \n\n\n\n\n\n### 5.3 Modeling gas by message.\n\nMany of the previously discussed techniques can be directly extended to study each gas component. Here we mention some additional approaches to model gas consumption by the type message.", "metadata": {}}}
