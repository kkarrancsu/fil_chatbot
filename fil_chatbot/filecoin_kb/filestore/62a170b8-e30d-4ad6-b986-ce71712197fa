This could be used as an opportunity to generate additional value by e.g., incentivising and promoting the creation of a decentralised QRDO liquidity provider.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that while the value generated by L1 transaction fees is not captured by Qredo (but rather by the Ethereum network), these volumes are also evidence of (i) the value that the company is created, even if indirectly and (ii) a potential market that can be partly captured, by, e.g., further incentivizing P2P trading inside the L2 Qredo network. \n\n\n## Token features\n\nNow that we have a clear picture of the value being generated by the Qredo Network, the next question is how to capture that value best and fairly distribute it among participants.", "metadata": {}}}
