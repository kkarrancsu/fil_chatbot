This results in simulations for nine distinct macroeconomic environments, which are summarized in Table 1 above. \n\nFor example, per Table 1 a simulation denoted as \u201cOB_med_SA_med\u201d means simulating the scenario in which the rate of daily onboarding is 8.1 PiBs per day, and for each day of onboarding, `50%` of the power onboarded is taking a `33%` shortfall. Said differently, if the amount of pledge required to onboard 8.1 PiBs on day $d$ is $P_{d}$, the amount actually put up by storage providers on the network on day $d$ is $(1-0.165) \\cdot P_{d}$.", "metadata": {}}}
