Data extracted between 1/1/2022 - 6/30/2022.*\n\nThe proposal increases the minimum and maximum sector durations. The new lower limit approximately doubles from 180 days to 1 year. This guards the network against negative short-term behaviors, aims to decrease turnover and improve stability. Since most SPs already store for longer durations (Figure 2), this isn\u2019t expected to be an overly burdensome change. The new maximum limit of 5 years gives SPs the option to express a long-term commitment to the network which was previously not possible with the maximum sector duration length of 540 days.\n\n## Linear Multiplier Slope and Initial Consensus Pledge Target Multiplier\n\n### Impact on percentage locked value\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"800\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/71FA1awAoiJ-rxMZbiVyKfvNQDzBOQUMrPEVNAR4trdnfQNN08wEwTQ76LCJUOqa0Bynu_NuHtnHtl9XHOKMNWQnVc7As4QGkAxPO82cIAnGENn8QU0lflDtXfEgink8Ok2pXZq1Gp1H2kGoXHU\">\n<br>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
