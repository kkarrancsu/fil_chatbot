If the seed is compromised, the entire randomness generation becomes insecure.\nDistributed randomness, when implemented correctly, doesn't rely on keeping seeds or other parameters secret. As long as a threshold of participants are honest, the protocol remains secure.\n\n**Trust and Transparency:** Public randomness beacons, especially when generated by a diverse set of well-known entities, can offer a level of trust and transparency that's hard to achieve with centralized or proprietary sources of randomness.\n\n\n## Some concepts of cryptography for Drand\n\n  Drand relies on a technique called BLS  (Boneh-Lynn-Shacham)-threshold cryptography to decentralize its operations. We now explain what this means in more detail. \n\n### Threshold cryptography", "metadata": {}}}
