This means in practice a blockchain where the entire mempool, $M$ fits entirely in the block every time. \n\nLet us first examine how a rational first price auction miner would behave in the infinite blockchain scenario, where they are seeking to maximize their utility, by maximizing the total network revenue, $\\sum_{j\\in B\\in M}p_j\\cdot g_j$.\n\n\n\nThe main problem with the infinite blockchain is that if every transaction fit in the block without any competition, this would drive down the gas costs all the way to $p_j=\\mu$, resulting in zero utility to the miner. \n\n### First price auction and effective block size", "metadata": {}}}
