These fees are only applicable to certain outgoing transactions, namely\n-  *Withdrawals*, which are external transfers to any other address not part of the Qredo Ecosystem, and \n- *Smart contract/API calls*, which are invoked when Deploying assets from a Qredo web3 Wallet into a Decentralized Application (dApp).\n\nWe discussed each of these use-case and the fee system in the previous [report](/4M4kpUI6QGGsyP_kpbcACw).\n\nAll other transfers within the Qredo ecosystem are not considered billable events. Qredo users do not pay service fees for assets under custody, depositing tokens, setup fees or maintenace fees. \n\nService fees can be paid in either QRDO, USDC or USDT. The network incentivises the use of the QRDO token by providing a 15% discount on these service fees if paid with the QRDO token. However, there are still a big majority of fees being denominated in USD.\n\n\n### Synthetic staking", "metadata": {}}}
