As we can see from the Figures on the left and in the middle, the time series and the histogram for the normalized gas process resemble the measured data. We plot the last 200 realizations of the demand process $\\{D_t\\}_{t\\geq 0}$  on the figure on the right. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8NM3FRJ.png)\n\n\nLastly, define the following indexation of the states: state 1= high demand, \nstate 2=very low demand, state 3=very high demand, state 4=low demand, and state 5=medium demand. We obtain a transition matrix $\\pi$ given by \n\n\n$$\\pi=\\begin{pmatrix}\n    0.26 &    0.05 &    0.04 &    0.26 &    0.39\\\\\n    0.10 &    0.37 &    0.03 &    0.28 &    0.22\\\\\n    0.28 &    0.04 &    0.04 &    0.25 &    0.39\\\\\n    0.14 &    0.21 &    0.03 &    0.35 &    0.26\\\\\n    0.22 &    0.12 &    0.04 &    0.29 &    0.34\n\\end{pmatrix},$$", "metadata": {}}}
