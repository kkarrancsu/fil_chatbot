The specific amount of tokens to be allocated to this specific fund will be determined in phase 2. \n2. **Ecosystem fund.** The rest of the tokens destined for staking rewards will come from an ecosystem fund created from *service fees.* In particular, a proportion of the service fees will be distributed to the validators. This proportion will also be determined in phase 2 of the project.", "metadata": {}}}
