This aims to solve the problem of a single point of failure by allowing any group of more than $t$ committee members to collectively decrypt ciphertext, while keeping the original plaintext secret, even if an attacker can compromise up to $t \u2212 1$ participants. Today, most encryption based MEV resistence solutions implement a threshold encryption scheme to offer MEV resistence.", "metadata": {}}}
