Then, in [Section 2](#2-QRDO-Token-and-its-utility), we present a concise review of the current utilities of the QRDO token, alongside an outline of its future features and utility. [Section 3](#3-Fee-Models) and [Section 4](#4-Staking-Model) focus on two new economic mechanisms for Qredo, namely the Fee Models and the Staking Model (respectively). In both these sections, we provide an overview of the mechanism and highlight what components will be defined in phase 2. We finalize the report in [Section 5](#5-Final-remarks), where we outline the next steps in the development and analysis of Qredo's tokenomics update.", "metadata": {}}}
