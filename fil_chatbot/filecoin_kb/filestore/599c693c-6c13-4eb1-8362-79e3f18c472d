For our analysis, we wanted to explore how the various mechanisms responded to different conditions and forecasting regimes.\n\nTherefore, we designed a set of scenarios to cover possible trajectories of these market inputs. Concretely, we built scenarios across three independent dimensions:\n\n- Token Price: This dimension models varying scenarios for the token price.\n- Network Usage: This dimension refers to different levels of network usage in terms of the number of transactions and service fees generated in USD.\n- Staking sentiment: This dimension represents varying levels of token locking and releasing due to participants\u2019 decisions within the Staking Mechanism.", "metadata": {}}}
