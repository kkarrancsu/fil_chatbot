Furthermore, the rate of change of this increase decreases as $a$ grows. Once again, this makes sense due to the choice of rate function. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryKq6KkY3.png)\n\n\nWe observe a tather mild effect caused by $b$:\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJejTtyth.png)\n\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the size of the ecosystem fund decreases with the max rate, and this rate of change becomes more pronounced as the max rate increases.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByYIid-tn.png)\n\n\nAs for the tipping rate, larger values of this parameter will result, over time, in a larger ecosystem fund. The rate of change of this stays fairly constant with respect to the tipping rate but becomes more significant over time. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkolCF1Y2.png)", "metadata": {}}}
