With features like Qredo Swaps and the integration with MetaMask Institutional, the platform allows for low-cost trading of crypto assets across different blockchains and secure access to Web3 dApps.\n\n## Project overview\n\nQredo is currently going through a decentralization process. They are moving from a model where validator nodes are operated by the team to a federated PoS where a set of trusted parties runs the validator nodes and users will stake directly into a single validator pool. This is an intermediate phase toward a final delegated PoS network (aka Phase 1).", "metadata": {}}}
