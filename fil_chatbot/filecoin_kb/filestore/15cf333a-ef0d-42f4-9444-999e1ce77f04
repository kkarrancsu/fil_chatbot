We examine the cryptoeconomic impacts of each option, from the perspective of Network Power, Locked collateral, and FoFR returns.\n* Of the proposed variants to update the Fil+ multiplier, the option where all sectors (regardless of whether they are Deal or CC) are given a 10x QA multiplier offers the most positive benefits to network security and new entrants into the system:\n    * From a network perspective, this better supports locked collateral, which is the primary source of consensus security for the network. \n    * This policy is also better for new SPs, who would otherwise have no multiplier to dilute costs, compared to current network power which would create minimal incentive for new SPs to join the network.", "metadata": {}}}
