At the same time, the price must be reasonable to make the goods or services produced unaffordable. One lever to achieve this balance is to adapt the token supply (on both inflows and outflows) to meet the demand for the token. Connected to this is the idea of tying token usage with the good or service produced by the economy, making it easier to assess demand. For instance, on Ethereum, users must pay gas fees in Ether to run computations on the Ethereum blockchain. This means that demand for Ether is strongly connected with the usage of the Ethereum EVM. At the same time, the total token supply is infinite. The protocol implements an algorithm to control minting rates so that there is a slow increase in token supply, thus meeting the expected growth in token", "metadata": {}}}
