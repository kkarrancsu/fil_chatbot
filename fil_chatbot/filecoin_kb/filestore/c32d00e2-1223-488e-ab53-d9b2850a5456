The main outcomes of the planned research project will be a full understanding of the potential gas-related risks of FVM (How too much gas demand, or too much gas supply from FVM could be harmful to Filecoin, and the relation of net FVM gas demand to several Filecoin health indicators.) Having understood the risk, the second outcome of this project is understanding how effective gas lanes plus adjustable target block size can be at combatting these risks (as well as recommending an optimal mechanism and parameter choice), vs the alternative of not doing anything and relying on the free market to self-regulate. We expect to complete the project by the end of Q1 2023.\n\n\n\n## FVM changes the gas economy", "metadata": {}}}
