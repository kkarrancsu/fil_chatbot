This large concentration is confirmed by examining the Gini index $G$, which we estimate to be ==COME BACK==. Presumably, many of these holders are institutional investors; indeed, [it can be seen](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x4123a133ae3c521fd134d7b13a2dec35b56c2463) that *KuCoin* controls, at least, 30M QRDO. While this concentration might seem extreme, such a concentration of wealth is not uncommon in Web3, as it is easily seen with other ERC20 tokens (c.f. the case of [WETH](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2) and [WBTC](https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599), for example). \n<div style=\"text-align:left\">\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1DQN1GNn.png\">\n</div>\n*Source: [Add source!!!]()*\n-->", "metadata": {}}}
