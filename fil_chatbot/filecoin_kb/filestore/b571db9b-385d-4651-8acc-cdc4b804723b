The status-quo scenario, where the historical median is continued as is, is shown in dark black, while scaled versions of RBP, RR, and FPR are shown and indicated in their respective legends. In Fig 5, we observe that Network RBP and Minting Rate only depend on RBP and RR, but not FPR. Fig 5B shows the QAP trajectory. A 20% increase in FIL+ rate, Renewal Rate, and onboarding rate than the historical median over the past 120 days results in an upward trajectory for QAP, locked, and a stable L/CS (for 1Y into the future). However, this 20% increase in all onboarding engagement (RBP, RR, FPR) still results in QAP being below the baseline. Thus, all scenarios result in decreased pledge and increased FoFR.\n\nOverall, these scenarios mimic the network state forecast using MCMC.", "metadata": {}}}
