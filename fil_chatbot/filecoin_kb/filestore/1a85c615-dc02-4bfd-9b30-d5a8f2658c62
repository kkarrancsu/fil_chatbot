The question really is how much collateral does that subnet need to provide to spawn.\n    - There are two aspects of \u201ccirculating supply\u201d within a subnet: initial deposit, and the balance of crossnet in and out transactions. Only the initial deposit seems to be locked, while the balance of transactions is liquid.  It is unclear how to use these for:\n        - \u201cMining rewards are proportionately distributed among all subnets\u201d Does proportionately mean with the locked balance? the transaction circulating supply? Does this proportion also come with consensus power towards their parent chain?", "metadata": {}}}
