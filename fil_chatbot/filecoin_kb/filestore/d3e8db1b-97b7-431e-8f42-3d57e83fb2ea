But usually this isn\u2019t enough to cover the extra costs being a storage provider incurs, such as BizDev, data prep, duplication, serving data and more, as well as to make up for the potential sporadic returns of starting a storage provider business dependent on Deal Income.  \n\nWithin the current framework, this leaves the Quality Multiplier to make up the difference and lower the bar to make storing data rational.", "metadata": {}}}
