If baseline crossing occurs, the new block rewards shared between all SPs will be lower. However the effect for individual SPs is more nuanced. \n\nIt is likely that baseline crossing is also accompanied by a reduction in Initial Pledge --- see Figure 5A. In part this is because the decrease in minting rate affects circulating supply, which is a multiplicative factor in  the definition of consensus pledge, which is the largest component of Initial Pledge.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJWjb-S_o.png)\n*Fig. 5.
