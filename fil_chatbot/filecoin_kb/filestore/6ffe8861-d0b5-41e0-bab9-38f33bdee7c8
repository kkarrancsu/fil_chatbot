Cianci, CryptoEconLab, July 2023\n\nThe Qredo Network is a decentralized custody platform designed to offer businesses and investors a secure and efficient way to manage digital assets. \n\nQredo is currently going through a transaction phase. In 2021, they launched their token (QRDO), and, since then, they have been working on a set of features to improve its usability and increase decentralization. Concretely, the network aims to evolve across three main axes:\n\n- **A1**. Increased decentralization through a Federated Proof-of-Stake consensus system (and, later on, Delegated Proof-of-Stake). \n- **A2**. Enhanced the role of QRDO as Qredo's utility token.\n- **A3**. More transparency and community engagement through open governance.", "metadata": {}}}
