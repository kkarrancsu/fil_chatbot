This change in gasUsuage affects the relationship between the $CrossoverNetworkBaseFee$ and $NumProofsBatched$, and, therefore, the breakeven curve for which miners should be indifferent between submitting $n$ single proofs or batching $n$ proofs at a given *BaseFee*.   \n\nTo account for the uncertainty surrounding gas increase associated with a given proving opersation, we calculate the breakeven curves over sampled FVM gas increase multipliers (with current network *BatchBalancer* and *BatchDiscount* parameters) and compare this to the current network breakeven curve\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gU7WUmG.png)\n\nThe takeaway is that **given current network conditions** miners will likely have to **aggregate more proofs at any given network *BaseFee* in order for batching to be preferable to submitting single proofs**.", "metadata": {}}}
