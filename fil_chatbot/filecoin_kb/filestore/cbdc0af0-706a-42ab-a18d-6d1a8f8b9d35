Although the same trends seem to hold for network recovery, we flag the severe drop in RBP as a potential risk for further destabilization - that is not captured by the simulation framework. External risks in this scenario can include public sentiment towards the network after such a severe drop. Understanding whether larger or smaller SP operations are more likely to leave the network will be prudent. Suppose smaller operations are more likely to leave/terminate. In that case, we can expect the larger SPs to be able to onboard more data due to potentially better access to lending markets and larger capital reserves, thereby tending towards the optimistic scenarios presented. Conversely, if larger operations leave, we may be closer to the pessimistic scenario, which is a cause for greater concern.", "metadata": {}}}
