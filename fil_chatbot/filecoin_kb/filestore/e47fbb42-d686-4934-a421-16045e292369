The more a delegate has to lose, the more likely they are to validate transactions correctly. To enhance security, some DPoS systems require delegates to lock up a certain amount of the native cryptocurrency as collateral, known as *staking* or *bonding*. This collateral can be slashed (partially or fully) if they act maliciously.\n\n#### Scalability and Efficiency\n\nBy reducing the number of nodes participating in the consensus, DPoS can increase the speed and scalability of the blockchain. Blocks can be created and validated faster, allowing the network to handle a higher transaction throughput.", "metadata": {}}}
