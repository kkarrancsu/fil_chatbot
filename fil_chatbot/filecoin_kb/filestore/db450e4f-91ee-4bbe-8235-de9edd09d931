The bond manager accounts for **gas costs spent by a Verifier** in case of a challenge; (c) a Bridge Contract that implements  L1\u2192L2 and L2\u2192L1 transactions, (d) a standard bridge for \"transferring\" either ERC-20 tokens or ETH between L1 and Optimism. **To deposit tokens into Optimism, the bridge locks them on L1 and mints equivalent tokens in Optimism.** To withdraw tokens, the bridge burns the Optimism tokens and releases the locked L1 tokens; and (e) predeploys, a set of essential L2 contracts which are deployed and available in the genesis state of the system. These contracts are similar to Ethereum's precompiles.\n\n***Arbitrum***\n\nThe primary components of Arbitrum are Aggregators, Validators, Compiler, and the EthBridge.", "metadata": {}}}
