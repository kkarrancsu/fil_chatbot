The question to fix $B^T$ is *what is the maximum block size that the network can process consistently?* The maximum block size $2B^T$, is fixed by answering the question *what is the maximum block size that the network can process if  ocassionally needed, but not in a sustained manner?*\n\nHere we question whether fixing the value of $B^T$ should only be an engineering constraint, and whether economic incentives should play a role in fixing the target block size, as well as whether a dynamic, adjustable target block size is needed.\n\n## Motivation, hyperdrive and batch balancer\n\nTo understand why we should have a variable target block size, we must ask what is it we want the EIP 1559 mechanism to do. The original motivation for EIP 1559 is not to manipulate or alter transaction fees, but to make the transaction fee process more predictable and user friendly.", "metadata": {}}}
