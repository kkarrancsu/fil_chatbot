This function will assign a larger piece of the pie to a staker according to some measurable conditions, such as assigning a larger portion to stakes with a larger balance, those who actively participate in the election process, the delegate they voted for (in DPoS), as well as those who have held the token for a longer time.\n\n The proportion of this split (e.g., whether it is 50-50, 40-60, etc.), together with the specific functional form and parameters of the *validator and staker score functions*, will be decided in phase 2.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hkd7Nec_2.png)\n\n\n### Locking.\n\nLocking is an essential part of any consensus mechanism derived from proof-of-stake. In particular, it enhances network security while simultaneously impacting token demand and circulating supply.", "metadata": {}}}
