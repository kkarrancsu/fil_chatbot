This is illustrated in Fig. 5B. The extent to which an increase may happen depends on the minting rate unit economics, which depend on future onboarding and sector extension. \n\nA key takeaway is that the reduction in supply and minting rate should not be equated with a reduction in ROI: Filecoin's micro and macroeconomics are designed to be resilient and adapative across a range of scenarios. \n\nAgain it should be emphasised that the simulated Initial Pledge and ROI trajectories are sensitive to network power: if FIL+ rate, raw byte onboard, or sector extension rate change substantially the forecast trajectories will change. This is partially captured by the wide range of projection bands in Fig. 5A-B, for which the uncertainty is parameterised in terms of historical variation. However, historical variation does not fully describe future uncertainty: events beyond the scope of the model can always occur.", "metadata": {}}}
