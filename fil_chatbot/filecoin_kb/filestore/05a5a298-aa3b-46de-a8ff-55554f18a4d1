We also added a multiplier to allow us to test diferent scenarios. More precisely, denoting by $A_\\text{Qredo}(t)$ the service fees expected by Qredo, we model the service fees vector in MechaQredo as \n\n\\begin{aligned}\nA_\\text{fees}(t)= m_\\text{fee} \\cdot A_\\text{Qredo}(t)+\\sigma_\\text{fee} W(t),\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwith $m_\\text{fee}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ the multiplier, $\\sigma_\\text{fee}>0$ the volatility of the service fees and $W(t)$ a Wiener process (independent of the Wiener process of the price). By doing this, we provide a model that, on the one hand, aligns with Qredo's prior work on forecasting their future service fees, while at the same time capturing some of the uncertainty associated with said forecast.", "metadata": {}}}
