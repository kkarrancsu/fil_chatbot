This will immediately avoid the problem of having potentially valuable space poached by FVM-related messages. However, one would need to be more careful when defining the lane-specific base fee.\n\n**Remark 1.** At the time of writing, `SubmitWindowPoSt `messages take, on average, around 20-25% of the used block space at any given block; see [here](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures/transactions-usage#gas-usage-by-methods).\n\n**Remark 2.**  The idea of having multiple Mpools was also mentioned in some discussions. We believe, however, that such an approach can be framed as a particular case of the gas lanes approach.\n\n\n### Long term\n#### IPC.", "metadata": {}}}
