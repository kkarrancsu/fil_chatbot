Our experimental results consist of four figures for each combination of input/output. On the top left figure, we plot the *marginal*, on the top right, we plot the sensitivity, on the bottom left we plot the average change on a given output quantity that a 1% change in the input quantity produces, and on the bottom right figure we plot the standard deviation of this change.\n\n\n\n### Circulating supply\n\nWe begin by analysing the circulating supply. Our analysis reveals that  *validator's reward share* has minimal influence.\n\n\n\nAs for  the protocol fee rate, we notice that there is a slight tendency of decreasing circulating supply as this parameter increases. As we can see by the the figure on the left, the rate of this change is fairly constant and mild for different values of the protocol fee rate.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hy3CFOZFn.png)", "metadata": {}}}
