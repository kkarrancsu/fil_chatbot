The network could regulate sprawl by finding the optimal $N_{\\rm optimal}$ that would maximize the network target.\n\n\n### Built-in IPC\n\nIn its earliest form, [IPC was proposed as a Filecoin-native scaling solution](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/419). This version of IPC would be similar to sharding, except for arranging the shards into a hierarchical topology (hence its previous name \"Hierarchical Consensus\"). In this case there would exist the Filecoin rootnet, which must allocate some of its gas resources to process checkpoints from $N_1$ subnets that operate directly under it. There are in turn $N_2$ subnets that checkpoint onto the first layer of subnets, consuming some of their gas resources, and so on with any possible number of layers.", "metadata": {}}}
