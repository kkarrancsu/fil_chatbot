This fund will be used to cover incentive programs for network participants, with a focus on user adoption.\n2. Increase the size of **Ecosystem fund**. This fund will have a key role in the Qredo Protocol going forward and, as such, needs to have a larger allocation. This fund will serve two key roles: firstly it will cover the protocol fees of the protocol-funded transactions; secondly, it will be the repository of the service fees being tipped to the network and will control how these funds are released to fund the rewards of the Staking Model. These rewards will depend on the performance and growth of Qredo, thus aligning the participants of the Staking Model with the long-term goals of the network.\n3. Create a new fund to support the Staking Model for federated Proof-of-Stake, named **Staking Program Support fund**. This fund is aimed at supporting the rewards of the Staking Model by providing a predictable source of rewards.", "metadata": {}}}
