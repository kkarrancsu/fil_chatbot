Fees can be paid in either QRDO or USD. However, a large majority of these fees is currently paid in USD. In addition, in both cases, the total fee is aways denominated in USD. \n\nService Fees are a singificant portion of the vlaue being generated in Qredo's economy and, thus, we need to introduce a mechanism to transter this value into the native token, QRDO.\n\nHowever, having the possibility to pay service fees in USD is an important product feature since it increases the platform\u2019s usability. This is especially important for institutional clients as it simplifies their internal accounting and paperwork.", "metadata": {}}}
