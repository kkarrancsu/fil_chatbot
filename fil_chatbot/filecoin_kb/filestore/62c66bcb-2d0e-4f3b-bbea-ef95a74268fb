Our models predict that while minting rate will decrease, storage providers ROI is expected to remain stable following the baseline crossing from above.\n- The regulation of supply in response to changes in rawbyte storage growth is a unique adaptive feature of Filecoin's minting. The predicted crossing shows the mechanism is working as originally designed and ensures alignment between the network's growth targets and storage providers' block reward incentives.\n \n\n## 1.
