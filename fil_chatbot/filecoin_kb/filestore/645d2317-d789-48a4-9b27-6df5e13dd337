DDO reduces the amount of gas needed when onboarding a deal sector by offering an alternative messaging pathway to PSD and reducing the gas needed for ProveCommit messages. \n\nThe reduction in gas usage changes the $\\mathtt{basefee_t}$ trajectory which then results in a change to the protocol revenue.  There are three relevant cases to consider:\n* Case 1 - There is no increase in onboarding or chain activity to fill emptied block space.\n* Case 2 - There is an increase in onboarding, but not enough of an increase to fill up excess block space.\n* Case 3 - There is an increase in onboarding and chain activity to fill up block space to the target of 5B gas units.", "metadata": {}}}
