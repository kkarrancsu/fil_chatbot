It is worth mentioning, however, that a notable exception is the vesting decay rate, which has a short-lived significant impact on circulating supply. \n\n\n### Yearly inflation \n\n\nThere is a rather insiginificant impact of protocol fee rate on yearly inflation. with such a parameter creating slightly decreasing effect on the yearly inflation\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1EQcuZth.png)", "metadata": {}}}
