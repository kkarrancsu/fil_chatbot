We plot 10000 steps of this process below. As we can see, the simulated process closely resembles that of $\\tilde{G}_t$. This method has the advantage of being data-driven and easily implementable, however, large values of $N_h$ might yield a computationally expensive algorithm. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/iQdglkp.png)\n\n\n#### 5.1.3 Gas as a bounded Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. \n\n\nBased on the observations that $\\tilde{G}$ is stationary, mean-reverting, and weakly autocorrelated, we propose the following variation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Let $\\mu,\\theta,\\sigma\\in\\mathbb{R}$ be three parameters representing the mean, the reversion rate, and the volatility of the process $Y_t$ given by \n\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t=\\theta(\\mu-Y_t)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\mathrm{d}W_t,$$", "metadata": {}}}
