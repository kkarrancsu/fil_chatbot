If Fil+ rate is increased but renewals stay roughly the same, then 10 PiB/day is sufficient.  Fig 9 shows the total amount of investment needed to achieve this onboarding trajectory.  The minimum value is close to 800M of USD, while other trajectories are more expensive. The current TVL of Filecoin at an exchange rate of 5USD/FIL is ~880M USD. Since the baseline doubles every year, it seems reasonable that an additional 800M USD of investment is needed to achieve the exponential growth that is necessary for QAP to catch back up to the baseline.", "metadata": {}}}
