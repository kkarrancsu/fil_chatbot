Optimistic rollups fundamentally cannot utilize off-chain data availability because there is no way to verify the validity of every single transaction without public data.  zkPorter puts data availability \u2014 essential the transaction data needed to reconstruct state \u2014 offchain rather than on Ethereum. Instead of using the main chain for public data, data availability is secured using proof of stake (PoS) by zkSync token stakers. This enables much higher scalability (tens of thousands TPS).  zkPorter uses Ethereum for transaction validity and zkSync token stakers for data availability.", "metadata": {}}}
