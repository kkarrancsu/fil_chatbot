A new token might be perfectly functional in utility terms, but if pools are paying 10%, people will be adverse to holding the token for any length of time (and by extension interacting with the system), unless supply is sufficiently deflationary, through either speculative demand, which isn\u2019t what we want to rely on, or mechanistically through burning or otherwise.\n\n **Summary of Findings**", "metadata": {}}}
