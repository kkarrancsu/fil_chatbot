As we explained before, the analysis uses a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation approach, which involves evaluating the deterministic model multiple times using sets of random numbers within a range of its inputs. Since allowing the full range of inputs would be untractable, we designed scenarios to cover possible trajectories of the market inputs.\n\nConcretely, we built scenarios across three independent dimensions:\n\n- Token Price: This dimension models varying scenarios for the token price.\n- Network Usage: This dimension refers to different levels of network usage in terms of the number of transactions and service fees generated in USD.\n- Staking sentiment: This dimension represents varying levels of token locking and releasing due to participants\u2019 decisions within the Staking Mechanism.", "metadata": {}}}
