More precisely, denote by $\\mathcal{M}$ the set of all possible messages, and let $p_{i,t}\\in[0,1]$ denote the probability of sending message $i\\in\\mathcal{M}$ at time $t$. Lastly, denote by $F_i$ the probability distribution of the non-zero realization of gas consumed by message $i$. Then, one could model the gas consumption of the $i^{th}$ by taking the following two steps\n\n1. with probability $p_i$,  sample $\\tilde{G}^i_t\\sim F_i$.\n2. Otherwise set $\\tilde{G}^i_t=0.$", "metadata": {}}}
