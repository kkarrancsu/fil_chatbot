For the remaining hardware that she does not recommit to the network, we assume the SP resells them and earns a rebate equivalent to the \u201csalvage value\u201d of the previously committed hardware. The alternative is for the SP to not terminate the $M$ sectors.\n\nThe incentive to terminate is then defined as the ratio of the ROI if the SP decides to terminate to the ROI if the SP decides to not terminate. \n\nThis is considered in the context of two group-level behaviors: a) the population of SPs decides to terminate and b) the population of SPs decides to not terminate.", "metadata": {}}}
