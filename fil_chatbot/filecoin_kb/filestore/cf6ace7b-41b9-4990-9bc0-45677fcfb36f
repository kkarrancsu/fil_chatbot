Currently, users can only trigger course-grained behaviors by submitting messages to built-in actors. However, once the FEVM is deployed, users will be able to deploy new smart contracts with fine-grained control over FVM execution. FIP--057 proposes a few adjustments to the gas charging schedule based on code optimization, gas accounting, and cost repricing of the computational cost of some syscalls (like writing and reading from storage, hashing) in order to bring them in line with their real compute cost.", "metadata": {}}}
