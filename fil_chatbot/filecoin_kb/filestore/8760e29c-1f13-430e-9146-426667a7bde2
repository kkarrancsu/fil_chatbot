This fragmentation can result in scarce liquidity because the capital of users is divided between the subchains.  Scaling solutions benefit the main chain, but liquidity off-ramping from the mainnet might counter these benefits.\n\nCross-chain token transfer involves several challenges such as (i) how to issue tokens on the chains and ways to disable tokens when they are leaving the blockchain, (ii) rebalancing of tokens across blockchain to maintain liquidity, \n\nAs previously noted, both Arbitrum and Optimism use bridges to interact with other blockchains. However, where Arbitrum employs a universal and permissionless bridge for all tokens, Optimism deploys dedicated bridges when the market demands are ripe.", "metadata": {}}}
