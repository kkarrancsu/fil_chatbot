This enhances message inclusion while necessitating adjustments in the target gas usage mechanism to control fee growth.\n- *Lane-Adjusting Mechanism:* A proportional allocation based on Raw Byte Power (RBP) emerges as a suitable choice. This mechanism adjusts lane sizes based on the network's health and prioritizes messages effectively. However, we remain open to alternative proposals that provide more precision.\n- *Multi-Fee vs. Discounted/Adjusted Gas Lanes*: We highlight the isomorphism between the two mechanisms under specific adjustment factors. While multi-fee lanes provide fairness and revenue, discounted/adjusted lanes might offer a simpler user experience. The choice depends on whether a pure discount mechanism is desired.\n- **Call to Action  for Stakeholders & next steps.**", "metadata": {}}}
