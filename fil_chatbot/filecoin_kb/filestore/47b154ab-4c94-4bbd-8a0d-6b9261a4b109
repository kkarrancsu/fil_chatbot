Given a new pool of funds to distribute in Saturn, how should the pool be distributed through time? In particular, we test two options - a constant pool and a growth pool (more details will follow in the dedicated subsection)\n2. What should be the final scoring function? Assuming that we use a direct multiplication function, what should be the exponent for bandwidth and the exponent for speed performance and uptime?\n3. What should be the final penalty multiplier and does it work as intended?", "metadata": {}}}
