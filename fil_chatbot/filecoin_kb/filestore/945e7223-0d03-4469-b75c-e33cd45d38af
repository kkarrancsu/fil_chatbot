We introduce the *effective quality multiplier*, $q^\\prime$, which is defined such that the reward given throughout *the remainder* of the sector lifetime is such that the total reward given out through *all* of the sector lifetime is the same as the total sector reward computed above. In this case we have\n$$ Total\\,sector\\,reward=q\\int_{t_0}^{t^\\prime}\\frac{R(t)}{P(t)Q(t)}dt+q^\\prime\\int_{t^\\prime}^{t_0^L}\\frac{R(t)}{P(t)Q(t)}dt$$\n\nWe note that this calculation is done at time $t^\\prime$, such that it involves predicted quantities for what will happen between $t^\\prime$ and $t_0+L$. As such the second integral should actualy read,\n$$\\int_{t^\\prime}^{t_0^L}\\frac{\\hat{R}(t^\\prime;t)}{\\hat{P}(t^\\prime;t)\\hat{Q}(t^\\prime,t)}dt.$$", "metadata": {}}}
