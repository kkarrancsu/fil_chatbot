These data are already stored on the Filecoin network.  The number of storage providers and the number of copies of the data would be interesting to know.   Earth imagery requires a number of standard processing steps (e.g., calculating vegetation index, cloud removal, image stitching, image timepoint deltas) before it is useful for most applications.  Bacalhau could make these computations right where the data sit; thus requiring no data ingress.  This fact is a serious competitive edge for Bacalhau over other data set providers and traditional map/reduce-style platforms.  The other ecosystem players are not clear about how raw data enter the network.", "metadata": {}}}
