In this case, their utility is maximized whenever tokens are burnt due to the EIP1559 mechsnism. Once again, there are several ways of expresing a utility function of this form, but a possible one could be\n\n$$ U_\\text{burn}(D,p;S,W_m) := W_m \\left(\\frac{S}{S-Dp}\\right),$$\n\nwith $W_m$ the token wealth of the $m$-th SP and $S$ the circulating supply. Notice that as $D$ or $p$ increase, the amount of token burnt incerases, thus decreasing the circulating supply. Thus, this particular choice of utility function is maximized whenever $D$ and $p$ are maximized. Below, we show $U_\\text{burn}(p)$  vs $D(p)$ (left) and $U_\\text{burn}(p)$ vs $p$.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkdLedrAs.png)\n\nAs expected, such a function is maximized at around the maximum level of base fee that still provides some level of demand; i.e., around $10^{-8}$ FIL per gas unit", "metadata": {}}}
