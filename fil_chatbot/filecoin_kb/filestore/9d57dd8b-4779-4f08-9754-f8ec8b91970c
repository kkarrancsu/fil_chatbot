Introduction and setup.\n\n#### Understanding miner utility\n\nWe begin with a definition. We denote the *expected miner utility* of the $j^\\text{th}$ miner at an epoch $t$, by\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathsf{Utility}_{t,j}=\\textsf{Expected tokens in}_{t,j}-\\textsf{Expected tokens out}_{t,j}.\n\\end{aligned}\nHere, $\\textsf{Expected tokens in}_{t,j}$ are the total amount of tokens that the $j^\\text{th}$   miner is expecting to receive at epoch $t$ and similarly $\\textsf{Expected tokens out}_{t,j}$ are the expected number of tokens that they are going to spend at such an epoch due to messages sent. In this setting, we say that a miner is *profitable* (under our definition of utility) if their expected miner utility is positive.", "metadata": {}}}
