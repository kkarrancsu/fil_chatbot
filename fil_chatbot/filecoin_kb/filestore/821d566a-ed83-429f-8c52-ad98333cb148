This has the UX/UI advantage of knowing an upper bound on the cost of including a message (given by the single-laned cost of doing so), but it is subjected to loss of network revenue.  \n\n\n## Next steps and call to action. \n- We (CEL) would like to get alignment from the stakeholders in the design space, the proposed model, as well as other clear technical details that we might have missed in this discussion. Points related to feasibility, impact, security concerns, and backward/forward compatibility are especially appreciated.", "metadata": {}}}
