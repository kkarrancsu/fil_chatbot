Intuitively, the adjusted approach *may* offer a simpler UX, as there is a single base fee that gets adjusted according to the lane's consumption. From a UI perspective, this could be easier to display and understand. However, it's important that the adjustment factor is communicated clearly to the user, as it still affects the total cost of transactions.", "metadata": {}}}
