These parameters were obtained after running a full sweep of various possible parameter values. The full analysis can be consulted in its [report](/CBD_V8E5RzOf7oTSF-MnCQ).\n\nWhen we look at the circulating supply for QRDO, there will be two separate phases for the proposed tokenomics update, namely, at the start of day zero (i.e. when the new tokenomics are introduced), and after day zero.\n\nAt the start of day zero, there will be a large shift in the circulating supply. Assuming that the circulating supply before day zero was at the current level (as of June 2023), we expect the circulating supply to grow from 339M to an average of 639M. The increase in 300M tokens is the result of the following token flows:", "metadata": {}}}
