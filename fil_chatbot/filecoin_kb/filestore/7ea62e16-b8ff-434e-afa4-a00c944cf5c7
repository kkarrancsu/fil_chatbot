In an ideal case, datacap abuse would be kept to a minimum. We believe that by improving the incentive structures in place, we can address this problem and make significant steps towards achieving the goal of no datacap abuse.\n\nFor instance, escalating penalties for bad notaries and SPs, similar to the verification game used by [Truebit](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~teutsch/papers/truebit.pdf) and the solver challenger framework used in optimistic rollup, is a way in which datacap abuse can be addressed.
