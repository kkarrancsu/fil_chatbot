This corresponds to the fees captured by the network, its transaction volume, and the price and transaction volume of the `QRDO` token. We now present a quick analysis of these quantities. \n\n\n### Billable volumes\n\nThis section focuses on the billable transactions within the Qredo network. We present a histogram of these transactions alongside their summary statistics below. The figures distinguish between MetaMask Institutional (MMI) and others (QL2). Note that the histogram uses a logarithmic scale.\n\nAs depicted, MMI transactions, on average, move six times the volume of QL2. However, there is a substantial variation in this amount, evidenced by a considerable standard deviation. A glance at the quantiles indicates that the volume handled by MMI transactions consistently surpasses that managed by QL2.", "metadata": {}}}
