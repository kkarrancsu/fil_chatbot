For this, we use average rates based on the daily rate of return experienced at each simulation step $t$:\n\n* Total value locked in staking: $L_\\text{stake}(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^t L_\\text{stake}^\\text{in}(i) - L_\\text{stake}^\\text{out}(i)$\n* Daily rewards: $R_{s}(t)$\n* Daily interest rate (simple): $r(t) = R_{s}(t) / L_\\text{stake}(t)$\n* Projected APR: $\\text{APR} = 365 \\cdot r(t)$\n\nWe should note that the APR is subject to change over a year as every day the interest rate changes based on changes in TVL and total rewards available.", "metadata": {}}}
