Saturn's servers are decentralized and, as such, the costs and reward structures are not compatible with a centralized or hybrid model. In addition, for the purpose of the first version of Saturn, we are interested in defining how a given pool of rewards should be split among node operators. In other words, we focus on the seller side of the retrieval market and try to define an optimal distribution of rewards that incents participation towards a set of shared goals.\n\nThis is similar to a concept proposed by Wilkins et al. [4], the marketized-commons platform, which is defined as a platform attempting to \u201cincentivize collaborative efforts through market principles\u201c. In this model, everyone benefits from the collective action, but participation is costly. In Saturn, all internet users will benefit from a faster content delivery, while node operators will carry the cost of participation.", "metadata": {}}}
