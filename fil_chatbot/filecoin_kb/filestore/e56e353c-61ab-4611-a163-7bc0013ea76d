Coins have their own native blockchain and typically have a specific utility over the whole network, like paying for transaction fees, staking or taking part in governance.  Tokens are built on pre-existing blockchains and have many similarities to coins; however, tokens mainly have utility in their own projects.  For example, ERC-20\u00a0tokens issued on the Ethereum blockchain are each part of a specific project with different use cases.\n\nOptimism uses Wrapped ETH (WETH), pegged to ETH in a 1:1 ratio.  WETH allows for cross-chain ERC-20 token compatibility.  Arbitrum has native ETH support; all transaction fees for Arbitrum are paid in ETH.   Polygon Nightfall enables token transfers of ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens.  Arbitrum does allow for minting of tokens on L2.", "metadata": {}}}
