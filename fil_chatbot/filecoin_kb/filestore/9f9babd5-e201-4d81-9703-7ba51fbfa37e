Because of this, there is no notion of a block gas limit; instead, the overall gas consumption is rate limited based on time segments, called epochs. There is a separate gas limit per epoch for sequencer submitted transactions and L1 to L2 transactions. Transactions exceeding the gas limit for an epoch return early.  An operator can post several transactions with varying timestamps in one on-chain batch.\n\n### Arbitrum\n\nArbitrum uses ArbGas along with L1 fixed cost and calldata cost to compensate the chain\u2019s Validators for their expenses.  Arbitrum fees include (1) L1/L2 bridge fee (costs much more than L1 transfer), (2) L1/L2 fixed cost (inclusion to Layer 1 inbox) (3) calldata (transactions are written on Ethereum) and (4) L2 computation costs,  The\u00a0ETH data inbox and calldata cost the majority of the fee.", "metadata": {}}}
