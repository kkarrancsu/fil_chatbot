They hold a piece of the economy by buying and holding their native token. Holding the token will give them specific access to discussions and/or decision-making power, depending on the governance model. Token holders are not directly compensated by the economy. Their incentive should be to access the governance process. In reality, we know that speculation also plays a part in the incentives for token holders. However, in the long run, this is unsustainable for the economy. Holding tokens without actively participating in the economy (as Stakers and/or Clients) should be the exception, not the rule. As with Stakers, token holders can impact token demand as they are a key group in the secondary market for native tokens.", "metadata": {}}}
