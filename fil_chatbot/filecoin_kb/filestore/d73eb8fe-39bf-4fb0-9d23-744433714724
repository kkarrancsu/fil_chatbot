This issue of gas \"Sprawl\" was discussed [in  the context of Interplanetary Consensus](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/discussions/64) (IPC) as a built in actor, a previously proposed solution to scaling capacity in Filecoin. The current version of IPC is planned to be deployed entirely as an L2 scaling solution using FVM. \n\nThe risks of sprawl previously associated with IPC, are then now to be considered a possible outcome of the introduction of FVM.\n\n\n## Sprawl is relative\n\nTo determine if the network is \"sprawling too much\" we must define a network target. The target definition encodes the values of the Filecoin network and answers the question \"what should the Filecoin gas economy be optimizing for?\"", "metadata": {}}}
