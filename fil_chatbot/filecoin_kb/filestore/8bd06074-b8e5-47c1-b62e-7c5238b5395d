That operator would not take any rewards for themselves, but would be able to reduce the value given to the remaining operators, which is worrisome. Thus, to avoid this, when a node operator is flagged and exhibits a strange high bandwidth served, we need to adjust the rewards of the remaining operators to avoid reducing their own rewards significantly.\n\nWe have few options to achieve this. When calculating the reward share for a given time period, we will have the aggregated performance metrics for all node operators. There are three things we can do to the aggregated data to adjust rewards after an operator is flagged:", "metadata": {}}}
