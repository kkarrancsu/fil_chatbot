DPoS further democratizes this process by allowing token holders to vote for a select group of validators (delegates), who then carry out the network validation tasks. The FPoS consensus mechanism works similarly; however, in that setting, the (potentially third-party) \"delegates\" are \"voted in\" by a centralized authority, such as the network itself. In other words, validators in the FPoS must go through a vetting process before they are approved as validators.", "metadata": {}}}
