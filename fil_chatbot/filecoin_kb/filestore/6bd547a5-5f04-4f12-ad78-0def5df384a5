Recall that the reason we do this is that we don't have an easy way of getting the real data from the network at the moment. This will be something to improve on later models.\n\n$$knownSE^{QA}(t) = (1 + 9 * \\textrm{fil_plus_rate}) \\cdot knownSE^{RB}(t)$$\n\nThe third and final variable we need to change is the renewals. Because we need to adapt the duration multiplier based on the longevity of the sectors, we use the RB power renewed at $t$ and apply the correct multiplier, considering both the rate of FIL+ deals ($\\gamma$) and the duration multiplier slope ($m_{dur}$):", "metadata": {}}}
