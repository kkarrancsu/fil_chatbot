For the sake of argument, suppose that the base fee in Ethereum is currently $1\\times 10^{-9}$ ETH/gas unit and that the base fee on the polygon network is $100\\times10^{-9}$ MATIC/gas unit. The cost of that `transfer` in either network amounts to 0.000021 ETH in Ethereum and 0.0021 MATIC in Polygon. In terms of *tokens*, this example clearly shows that the Ethereum transactions have a lower gas cost; however, it is work mentioning that, at the time of writing, 1 ETH $\\approx$ 1829 MATIC, and as such the transaction in Polygon would then be the cheaper of the two. For completeness, a `send` transaction in Filecoin, takes about  1,273,063 gas units. While this seems much larger than the other two, it is important to remember that these are units of a different network. A base fee of 0.5 $\\times 10^{-9}$ FIL/gas unit would result in about $0.00065$ FIL for that", "metadata": {}}}
