It is important to note that to estimate the total gas costs for a sector, we used the current anual average cost of pre-commit, prove-commit and spacetime proofs messages taken from [Starboard's dashboard](https://dashboard.starboard.ventures).\n\n#### Impact of the central scenario\n\nWe started the analysis by using the simulation's central scenario. This is the scenario where the average duration of sectors in the network is 3 years and the duration multiplier is a linear function with a slope of 1x for 1-year sectors. With this scenario, we then modeled the total FoFR and the annualized FoFR for 4 different sectors:", "metadata": {}}}
