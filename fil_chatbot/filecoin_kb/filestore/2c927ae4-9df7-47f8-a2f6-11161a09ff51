This would include an evaluation of both the validity of the challenges presented by the Challenger and an assessment of the Solver's adherence to the established regulations.\n* **Punishment and Incentives**: In the event that the challenges are validated, and abusive behavior is substantiated, penalties might be imposed upon the offending party. These penalties could include fines or temporary suspension of datacap privileges. Conversely, if the challenges prove unfounded and the Solver's practices are indeed legitimate, the Challenger could be responsible for covering the expenses linked with the verification process, thereby ensuring that this privilege is not abused.", "metadata": {}}}
