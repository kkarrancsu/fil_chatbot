However, to achieve this vision, Qredo's underlying tokenomics and its native token need to adapt, which is the reason why the Qredo Team partnered with CryptoEconLab to revamp the tokenomics of the Qredo network.\n\nThis collaboration was designed to encompass two main phases - the draft phase and the tuning and validation phase. The idea was to provide the general framework for the new tokenomics earlier and collect feedback before delving into the details of tunning and validating its key parameters.\n\nThis report provides an overview of the results obtained in the second phase and puts forward a proposal for the key tokenomic parameters that were left undefined after the first phase. For an overview of the first phase of the project, you can read the [intermediate report](/7hrz1PFOTyqr6Bohk0roFg).", "metadata": {}}}
