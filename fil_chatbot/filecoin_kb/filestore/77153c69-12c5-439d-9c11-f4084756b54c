Under this model, a percentage of the service fees collected by Qredo LLC is tipped to the network. This means that part of service fees is converted from USD to QRDO and locked in the Ecosystem fund. This mechanism has a double effect on the network's economics. Firstly, lower token prices lead to higher exchange rates, which in turn leads to more tokens locked in the Ecosystem.  Secondly, more network usage leads to more service fees collected, which also leads to more tokens locked in the Ecosystem fund. So, more usage and lower token prices lead to more tokens being locked. And why is this a good design? Well, more tokens locked in the Ecosystem Fund have two main effects, namely reducing circulating supply and increasing the tokens available to pay Validators and Stakers.", "metadata": {}}}
