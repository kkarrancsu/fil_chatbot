Model.\n\nWe begin by stating a perhaps obvious, but important (and not so innocent) assumption.\n\n**Assumption 1.**  *There are $L\\in\\mathbb{N}$ different classes of messages, and each message belongs to exactly one class $c_\\ell$, $\\ell=1,2,\\dots,L$, i.e., no message can belong to two or more classes.*\n\n\n**Remark.** The previous assumption requires carefully classifying messages as the line thaty separates different classes of messages can become blurry. An example of an edge case is where we have two classes of meesages: FVM and non-FVM (e.g., network maintenance), and an FVM user invokes a contract that takes care of maintenance-related tasks, such as `submitWindowedPost`. This classification is worth discussing in more deailt with the wider community. \n\n\nWe present a simplified model for gas lanes, and discuss several possible extensions in the next Section.", "metadata": {}}}
