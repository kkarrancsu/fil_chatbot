Induce a greater rate of deal and capacity onboarding than current levels (~5-6 PiB/Day)\n2. A similar or increased rate of tokens locked relative to the current trajectory\n3. Reduced inflows to circulating supply due to reward locking and fees paid\n\nGiven that it is possible to achieve the stated goals above in a multitude of ways. CNL and CEL have provided the following specs of two variants of a potential network shortfall policy: (Known as Thing 1 and Thing 2).\n\n### Impact on Storage Onboarding Potential \n\nA potential benefit of a shortfall policy is to reduce onboarding frictions for Storage Provider's who are collateral constrained. A simple model for quantifying the impact of a network shortfall policy is estimated as: \n\n$$ \n\\begin{align*}\nDealOnboarding &= NoShortfallDealOnboarding * \\\\ &(1 + ShortfallEffectiveness * NetworkShortfall) \n\\end{align*}\n$$", "metadata": {}}}
