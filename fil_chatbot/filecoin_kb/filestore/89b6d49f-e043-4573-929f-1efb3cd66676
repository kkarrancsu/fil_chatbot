For instance, Qredo could start requiring the creation of a QL2 wallet for submitting MPC-sign transactions. From a technical perspective, this mitigation strategy will not be feasible for wallet creation transactions and deposits. Thus, these two types of transactions will require a deeper analysis.\n\nThirdly, the protocol can limit how many protocol-funded transactions can be executed at any given time. This mitigation strategy also needs a deeper analysis as it can also hurt usability.\n\n:::warning\n:warning: **Discuss with the team**  \n\n- What can we do to mitigate the attacks via Protocol-funded transactions?\n- Does transaction bandwidth increase with the number of validators?\n:::\n\n\n## Qredo service fees\n\n### How are fees collected?", "metadata": {}}}
