Naturally, this approximation provides an upper bound on the usage. Given this data, we proceed as follows. \n\n1. For each message $m$, compute the `adjusted_gas_limit` by multiplying the `gas_limit` of that message by its corresponding adjustment factor according to the Table. Notice that, due to technical and time constraints, we used `gas_limit` as opposed to `gas_used,` which results in an upper bound on our estimates.\n\n2. Group messages by epoch. For each epoch, add the `adjusted_gas_limit` of all the messages in that epoch. This number then gets divided by the total number of blocks on that epoch, yielding an estimate of the total gas usage per epoch.", "metadata": {}}}
