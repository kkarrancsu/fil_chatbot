In this case, we can define the following two ways of combining the two individual scoring functions into a new scoring functions:\n\n- Linear combination: $S(a_i, b_i) = q \\cdot S_1(a_i) + (1-q) \\cdot S_2(b_i)$, where $q \\in [0,1]$\n- Direct multiplication: $S(a_i, b_i)= \\frac{a_i^m \\cdot b_i^n}{\\sum_{j=1}^n a_j^m \\cdot b_j^n}$\n\nThe linear combination has the advantage of being easy to attribute relative value to each service metric (by changing the $q$ parameter). It is akin to having two reward pools since the service metric $a$ receives the fixed amount of rewards $qR$ while service metric $b$ receives the remaining. It is also simple to interpret, which is a huge advantage.", "metadata": {}}}
