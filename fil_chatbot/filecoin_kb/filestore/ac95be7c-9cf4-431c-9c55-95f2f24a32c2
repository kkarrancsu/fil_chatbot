Introduction \n\n#### Filecoin's Minting Model \nFilecoin uses a [hybrid minting model]((https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_token/minting_model/)) to encourage consistent storage onboarding and investment in long-term storage. \nThe hybrid minting model is a combination of simple and baseline minting that aligns block reward emissions with baseline storage targets. This enables the Filecoin network to reward storage providers proportional to the utility (i.e. storage power) they offer to the network. A visual explanation of those incentives are described in [this post](https://medium.com/block-science/a-cadcad-interactive-calculator-to-explore-minting-scenarios-in-filecoin-284009a2e941) by BlockScience on Minting Scenarios.", "metadata": {}}}
