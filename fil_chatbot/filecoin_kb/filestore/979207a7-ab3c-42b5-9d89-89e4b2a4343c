As shown below, the base fee started increasing around mid-February, **coinciding** with a rise in FIL's price. This increase in token price can be attributed mainly to favorable macroeconomic conditions, as stocks and other cryptocurrencies also experienced a rally during this period. While a higher token price might signal growing popularity in the network, it would be shortsighted to attribute the base fee spike to the price increase solely. While there is not enough supporting evidence to claim that token price influences base fee, perhaps a more sensible hypothesis is that the underlying macroeconomic conditions do contribute to these quantities. \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJgj9m4fh.png)\n\n\n\n\n### Conclusion", "metadata": {}}}
