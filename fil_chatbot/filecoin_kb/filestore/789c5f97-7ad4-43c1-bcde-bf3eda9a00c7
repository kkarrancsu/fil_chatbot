The Chain Key cryptography gives each canister its own Bitcoin public key, thus directly integating the blockchain with the Bitcoin network. Canisters are able to hold, send and receive their own Bitcoin but can only be changed with messages on the main blockchain.  The execution of canister code is deterministic, therefore, the canister\u2019s state can be audited.  The canister is a full smart contract.  Unlike a smart contract, canisters have processing capabilities that enable them to run applications at Internet scale.  \n\n**Consensus Mechanism**", "metadata": {}}}
