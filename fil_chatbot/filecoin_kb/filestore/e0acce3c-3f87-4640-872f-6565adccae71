Qredo Layer 2 transactions (QL2)**\n\nThe second use case is token swaps within Qredo's L2 network. Users can deposit any of the [supported cryptoassets](https://qredo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407177502097-Supported-Assets) and trade them with other Qredo users. Thus, Qredo Swaps enable cross-chain transactions, meaning users can swap digital assets between different blockchains, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin.\n\nTo use Qredo Swaps, users must first deposit their cryptoassets in the Qredo Network. When an asset is deposited, a synthetic version of that asset is created in the Qredo network - a qAsset. Users can swap qAssets freely inside the network.", "metadata": {}}}
