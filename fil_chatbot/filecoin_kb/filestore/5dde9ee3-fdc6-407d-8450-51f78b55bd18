This is the block reward collateral we discussed before. This locked collateral is then released linearly over 180 days. Thus, the equations for the locked FIL corresponding to block reward collateral are the following:\n\n$$\\Delta rewardL(t) = newRewardLocked_t - releaseReward_t$$\n\n$$newRewardLocked_t = 0.75 \\cdot dayRe_t$$\n\n$$releaseReward_t = rewardL(t-1)/180$$\n\n\n## References\n\n* [Model spec](https://hackmd.io/@msilvaPL/SkapZkrdc) for network power\n* [Filecoin documentation](https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-systems.filecoin_mining.miner_collaterals) on miner collaterals\n* [Code](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/blob/d56b240af24517443ce1f8abfbdab7cb22d331f1/actors/builtin/miner/monies.go#L162-L182) for the initial pledge collateral", "metadata": {}}}
