To that end, we propose the following model. Let us assume that the demand process is a discrete-time, discrete space Markov process taking values in the set of states \n\n$$\\text{States}:=\\{ \\text{state 1}, \\text{ state 2}, \\dots, \\text{ state $N_m$}   \\},\\quad N_m\\in\\mathbb{N},$$", "metadata": {}}}
