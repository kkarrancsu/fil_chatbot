To make the report easier to read, we will detail the main takeaways at the top of each subsection and display the corresponding plots afterward.\n\nNote that each plot encodes the average of each metric by day in a solid line and the standard deviation as a transparent band around the line. These standard deviation lines occur due to two main sources of variation:\n- The uncertainty around each scenario (recall that we take multiple samples for each scenario to measure the uncertainty of input variables such as the number of transactions, services fees, or token prices.\n- The variation caused by different combinations of tokenomic parameters.", "metadata": {}}}
