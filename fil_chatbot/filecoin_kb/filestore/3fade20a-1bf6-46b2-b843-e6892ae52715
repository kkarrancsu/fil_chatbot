{"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"page_content": "This utility function is a common choice in economic models of congestion pricing and dynamic pricing, where users are charged a fee for using a shared resource such as a road or a network. In these models, the goal is to encourage users to self-regulate their usage of the resource by charging higher fees during periods of high demand, and lower fees during periods of low demand. Users who are sensitive to the fees will adjust their behavior accordingly, leading to a more efficient use of the resource.\n\nIn the context of the Filecoin network, this utility function can be used to model the behavior of users who are sensitive to the base fee and prefer to wait for periods of low demand to submit their transactions, in order to minimize their costs. The utility function can be combined with other factors such as the urgency of the transaction and the value of the data being stored to model more complex user behavior.", "metadata": {}}}
