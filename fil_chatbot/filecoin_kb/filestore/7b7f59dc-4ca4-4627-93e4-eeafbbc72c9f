This second network will be public and node operators will be paid in Filecoin for their services. Interestingly, since the network won\u2019t have any crypto-economics design, RPs will be paid in a centralized manner based on the logs we submit. This is where this project will be most needed since we will have to **analyze these logs and determine if node operators are exhibiting any undesired behaviors**.\n\nFinally, in Q1 2023, we hope to complete a **detailed plan for the crypto-economics of retrieval** in Saturn. The idea is to use the learnings taken from the logs collected during H2 2022 to improve the way payments are distributed from content publishers to node operators.", "metadata": {}}}
