We will refer to these locked tokens as $L_\\text{fee}^\\text{in}(t)$.\n- When users stake tokens to participate in a federated Proof-of-Stake consensus system. We will refer to these locked tokens as $L_\\text{stake}^\\text{in}(t)$.\n- At the start of the simulation, when the entirety of the tokens in Ecosystem Fund are locked. e will refer to these locked tokens as $L_\\text{ecosystem}$.\n\nThefore, we can define the number of new tokens locked during step $t$ as:\n\n$$\nL^\\text{in}(0) = \n    L_\\text{fee}^\\text{in}(0) \n    + L_\\text{stake}^\\text{in}(0)\n    +L_\\text{ecosystem}\n$$\n\n$$\nL^\\text{in}(t) = \n    L_\\text{fee}^\\text{in}(t) \n    + L_\\text{stake}^\\text{in}(t), \\  t>0\n$$", "metadata": {}}}
