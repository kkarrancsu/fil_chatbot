This means that we will take the total rewards allocated to validators ($R_{v}(t)$), divide it by the number of validators ($N_\\text{val}(t)$) and subtract an estimate of the (per validator) daily operating costs ($\\text{OpEx}_\\text{val}$):\n\n$$\n\\text{Profit}(t) = \n    \\frac{R_{v}(t)}{N_\\text{val}(t)}\n    - \\text{OpEx}_\\text{val}\n$$\n\nThe previous estimator assumes a fixed OpEx cost for all validators. This quantity is a model input and, as such, we will further defined in [Section 2](#2-Model-inputs-parameters-and-possible-scenarios). \n\nNote that here we are not considering traditional profitability metrics such as APY. The reason for this is that Validators in the fPoS system will not be required to stake tokens. Instead, they are bringing their expertise and trust while covering the operational costs of running the protocol. Thus, the profit after OpEx is the most meaningful metric for this case.", "metadata": {}}}
