Even though it was faked, they were \"contributing\" bandwidth to the network. The traffic logged by the fraudulent operator is considered when rewards are computed for the entire network and, as such, some part of rewards are \"assigned\" to this operator. This means that during the time that the fraudulent operator is adding their logs, the total rewards assigned to the rest of the operators will be lower than a case where that operator never joins the network. This issue can be further worsened if the amount of fake traffic being logged is a significant proportion of the total traffic in the network.", "metadata": {}}}
