CoD appears to work mainly on smart contracts\n\nThe four ecosystem companies reviewed here all work on smart contracts between a Client and the Compute Provider.  A relevant security question is whether Bacalhau will use Turing-Complete contacts or Non-Turing-Complete contacts.  Turing-Complete smart contracts support various codebases and allow building complex structures with any set of computable functions; however, they are more vulnerable to attack.  Non-Turing-Complete programming languages are more specialized but they do not support vulnerabilities such looping, recursion, or other processes that are not guaranteed to terminate on their own.  \n\n### 2.
