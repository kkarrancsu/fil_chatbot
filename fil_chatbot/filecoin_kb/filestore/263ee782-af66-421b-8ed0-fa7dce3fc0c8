Recall that, for validators, we consider the USD profits and thus the metric is expected to be influenced by the token price scenarios.\n- As for the Ecosystem fund:\n    - The long-term balance of the Ecosystem fund is influenced by token price, usage, and staking sentiment.\n    - Lower token prices and higher network usage lead to more tokens being locked in the Ecosystem Fund, while higher TVL leads to higher release rates and lower fund balances.", "metadata": {}}}
