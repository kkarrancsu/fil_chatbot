Renewals may come from two different sets of sectors - active sectors and onboarded sectors. Thus, we define $R_{t}^{RB}$ as:\n\n$$R_{t}^{RB} = activeR_{t}^{RB} + onboardR_{t}^{RB}$$\n\nIn both sets of sectors, at the time they are expected to expire, a percentage of these sectors will renew. Thus, both components are simply the product between the renewal rate and the scheduled expirations for its groups of sectors:\n\n$$activeR_{t}^{RB} = r_t \\cdot activeSE_{t}^{RB} $$\n\n$$onboardR_{t}^{RB} = r_t \\cdot onboardSE_{t}^{RB} $$\n\nThe renewal rate is user-defined paramater and is a constant ($r_t = \\textrm{renewal_rate}$).\n\n\n## Quality-adjusted power\n\nThe equations for QA power are almost the same as the the ones for RB power, where one can simply exchange the $RB$ by $QA$. There are however two differences.", "metadata": {}}}
