Model inputs, parameters, and possible scenarios\n\n\n### Market inputs\n\nWe begin by describing the market inputs. Depending on the complexity of the chosen experiment, these inputs can be a constant, a deterministic function, or a stochastic process. There is a computational trade-off between these choices; while functions and stochastic processes are more flexible and able to represent a wider variety of scenarios, they are also more computationally expensive to simulate.\n\n\n#### Circulating supply at $t=0$, $C(0)$\n\nIn the context of our dynamic system models, we'll need to establish initial conditions to facilitate proper simulations. One critical initial condition is the circulating supply at the onset of a simulation, denoted as circulating supply at time 0, $C(0)$. This value can be sourced from the current vesting schedule corresponding to any specific date.\n\n#### QRDO Price in USD\n\nWe will rely upon the following assumption.", "metadata": {}}}
