To that end, we fit a seasonality model from [Meta's Prophet library](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api).  We can see that there do not seem to be any significant changes due to seasonality (less than one percent), as shown below. There, the shaded region corresponds to the uncertainty in a 10-day prediction for the trend. It is worth noting that perhaps a dataset with a larger timespan might be able to capture other seasonal components of the model. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9hnAoe8.png)\n\n### 3.4 Identifying demand peaks", "metadata": {}}}
