The daily network reward $dayRe_t$ comes from the minting model, *which we still need to document*. The circulating supply $C_t$ comes from the circulating supply model, *which we also haven't yet documented*. And finally, the baseline function, $b(t)$, is deterministic so there is no need to estimate it.\n\nWhat about the renewals? The delta pledge for renewals depends mostly on the scheduled pledge to expire $SP_t$, the renewal rate $r_t$, and the difference between the pledges of the sectors scheduled to expire computed at steps $t$ and $t-d$ (recall that $d$ is the sector duration).
