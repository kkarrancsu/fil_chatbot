The FIL+ variants we consider are a regular FIL+ SP, and three versions of FIL+ SPs who cheat the FIL+ system in various ways.  The specifics of each business profile are defined in [this article](https://hackmd.io/gzftJx5eQDKhv4-UEubSgg?view=#Business-Profiles).\n\nFor each profile, we compute the difference in FiatROI between choosing to be that particular variant of a FIL+ SP and choosing to be a CC SP. Since it is assumed that cheating FIL+ SPs do not actually store valuable data (and also don\u2019t have storage revenues), this difference in FiatROI\u2019s is a numerical proxy for the incentive to onboard Fil+ vs. CC.  A greater difference means that there is a greater incentive to onboard Fil+ sectors, and vice-versa.", "metadata": {}}}
