However, there are still some operators that manage to extract value from the network. In this case, the penalty multiplier has a significant impact on the value cheating operators are able to extract from the network (assuming that the scoring exponents are $k_1=0.5$ and $k_2=2$):\n\n* With a multiplier of 5x, these operators can collectively extract between 223 FIL during the 6 months. This is an average of 4.5 FIL per operator.\n* With a multiplier of 7x, these operators can collectively extract between 134 FIL during the 6 months. This is an average of 2.3 FIL per operator. \n\nWhat about the percentage of operators that manage to get at least one payout? With a multiplier of 5x, 46% of the cheating operators get at least one payout. This percentage is reduced to 21% when the multiplier is 7x.", "metadata": {}}}
