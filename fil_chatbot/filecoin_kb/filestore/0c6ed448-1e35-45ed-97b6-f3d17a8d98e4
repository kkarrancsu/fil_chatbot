What importance should these parameters have for an investor?\n\nIncreasing the token supply leads to inflationary pressure. Minting large amounts of tokens, without there beying demand for it, would lead to each token losing value. Therefore having a large maximum token supply can be seen as an indication that the token's value will decay over time.", "metadata": {}}}
