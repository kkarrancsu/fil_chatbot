Splitting means that we would assign specific amounts of Filecoin to specific groups of nodes (L1 vs. L2s) or to specific incentives (e.g., speed and reliability).\n\nHaving multiple pools allows us to tweak the incentives without having to change the reward distribution formulas. For instance, if we wish to incent the network to decrease the average TTFB, we could increase the pool assigned to fast retrievals and, as a consequence, there would be more rewards distributed for that specific behavior. Multiple pools also allow clients to pay differently based on the type of service they wish to have. For instance, a client could put more money into the \u201cspeed\u201d pool to incent a faster delivery.", "metadata": {}}}
