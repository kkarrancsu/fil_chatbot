A request may be executing a transaction within Qredo's Layer 2 network (e.g., token swaps between users, creating a wallet, etc.), executing a \"bridge transaction\" (i.e., depositing or withdrawing assets from Qredo to other blockchains), or signing/approving a transaction in another blockchain (e.g., remote calls to Ethereum contracts).\n\nInstead of using traditional private keys, Qredo's protocol employs a Multi-Party Computation (MPC) architecture. This method signs and validates transactions collectively, providing a higher level of security for users' assets.", "metadata": {}}}
