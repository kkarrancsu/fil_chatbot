It is important to note that raising the termination fee cap from 90 days of Expected Block Reward (as is currently specified in the protocol), to 180 days or 270 days of Expected Block Reward, could likely significantly lowers incentives to terminate and consolidate power. Fig 5 and 6 below that repeats the termination analysis above, but triples the termination fee cap to 270 days of Expected Block Reward.", "metadata": {}}}
