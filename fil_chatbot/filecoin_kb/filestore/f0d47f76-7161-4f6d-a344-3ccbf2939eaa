These changes are expected to cause a global increase of 1.95x in gas utilization (assuming current chain activity remains unchanged). As a result of this potential change in gas dynamics, CEL is investigating the current Balancer parameters in the event they may need to be adjusted to align with network expectations following FIP-32's rollout.\n\n### EDA on Gas Multipliers\n\nFIP-32 is expected to create a global increase in gas usage, but per the below figure, there is dispersion in this increase across methods. (See [FIP-32](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0032.md) Annex A for greater detail). \n![](https://i.imgur.com/oJGb0Lq.png)", "metadata": {}}}
