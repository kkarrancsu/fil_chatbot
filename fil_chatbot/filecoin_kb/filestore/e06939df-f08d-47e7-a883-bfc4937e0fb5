This would include a demonstration of the simulation tool and smart contract templates, as well as a walkthrough of the conceptual design. The presentation should effectively communicate the project's goals, the potential benefits of the proposed system, and how the deliverables achieved during the hackathon contribute to the broader vision of the project.\n\n## Challenges\n \nThe main challenge that we can identify priori is the tight deadline.  The project might be entirely too complex to be finalised in a week, due to both analytical and implementation challenges.  Once a team has been agreed upon, a revised version of the deliverables should be produced, making small consessions taking into account the size of the team, its expertise, etc.", "metadata": {}}}
