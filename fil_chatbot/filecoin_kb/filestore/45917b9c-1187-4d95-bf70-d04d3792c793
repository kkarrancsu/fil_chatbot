It serves as a connection between the Ethereum main network and Arbitrum.  Validators report back their off-chain processing results in the form of a \u201croll up block\u201d (assertion), which is posted on the Ethereum chain (optimistically without proof).  Validators check the assertion and prove fraud if it's wrong.  Validators that successfully prove fraud will receive a large reward.
