This could be thought of, e.g., as the typical user that would be attracted to the Filecoin network because of the FVM. Suppose that at any given epoch $t$, a given user $a$ sends $N_t$ messages to the network, where each message $j$, $j=1,\\dots, N_t$ has ($i$) an expected amount of profit per unit of gas, denoted by $w_{j,t}$, ($ii$) a user-defined bid $p_{j,t}$, satisfying $p_{j,t}>b_t$, and ($iii$) an amount of gas consumed $g_{j,t}$. The user utility in this case is si simply\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nu_{a,t}=\\sum_{j\\in\\text{Block}_t}(w_{j,t}-p_{j,t})\\cdot g_{j,t}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nNotice that a rational user would only include messages such that $w_{j,t}\\geq p_{j,t}$, which would also require that $w_{j,t}\\geq b_t$ for any epoch. \n\n\n**onboarding     costs**", "metadata": {}}}
