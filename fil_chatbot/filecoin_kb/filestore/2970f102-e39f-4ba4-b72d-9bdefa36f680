This assumes that the minimum time commitment is one month and that we are using the collateral formula described previously.\n2. The number of legitimate nodes in the Saturn network varies between 150 and 500.\n3. The attacker aims to control 1% of the network. (why such a low number? Because requests are routed based on regions and there will always be some regions with fewer nodes)\n4. The attacker joins the network with a given number of new nodes, pays the collateral, and severely impacts user experience by performing poorly. Out system would detect such attacker fairly quickly and the attacker is kicked out of the network without receiving their collateral back. Thus, they loose the entire collateral posted.", "metadata": {}}}
