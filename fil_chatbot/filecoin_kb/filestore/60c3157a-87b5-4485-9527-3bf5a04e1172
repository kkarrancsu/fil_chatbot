Notice that such data is presented relative to the maximum block size; thus, a value of gas used= 0.5 implies that such a block uses 50% of the maximum block size (i.e., the target block size). We observe the following.\n\n- The distribution of gas usage pre and post-FEVM are similar to one another, as can be seen from the histogram below. The most salient feature among these distributions, however, is that pre-FEVM, there's a more significant mass around 0.5 (i.e., the target). At the same time, for post-FEVM, there's a more prominent peak around 1, which indicates that the proportion of very full blocks increased post launch.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byb3iYjg3.png)", "metadata": {}}}
