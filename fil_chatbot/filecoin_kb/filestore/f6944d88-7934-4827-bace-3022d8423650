They typically rely upon expert information. In our case, this information translates into the estimates, pre-launch data, and opinion that our colleagues from product and engineering might have regarding the usage of FVM.  \n\n- *Aposteriori*. These are models/estimates that are obtained once data is available (i.e. after FVM launches). They are data-driven and as such they are in general more accurate, but would require FVM data, which is not available at the time of writing.   \n\n\n\n\n**Demand, $D_\\text{FVM}$.** \n\nWe will need to define a concept of total demand, as shown below.\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{Total \\ demand}=\\mathsf{status\\ quo\\ demand}+\\underbrace{\\mathsf{FVM \\ demand}}_{D_\\text{FVM}}\n\\end{align}", "metadata": {}}}
