Each of these critical elements has multiple associated parameters and potential variations. In this section, we discuss these terms in *plain terms.* We will present a more rigorous treatment of them in the next section. \n\nFor simplicity, and with a slight misuse of terminology, we use the term 'validator' in this section to refer to either a federated node in an FPoS or a delegate in a DPoS mechanism. Similarly, we will use the term 'Staker' to refer to a staking token holder.\n\n\n\n### Source of rewards\n\nHere we discuss how the rewards that will be distributed to the staking participants (i.e., stakes and validators) are collected and how they're made available for later distribution. \n\nFor Qredo, we will consider two specific token sources:", "metadata": {}}}
