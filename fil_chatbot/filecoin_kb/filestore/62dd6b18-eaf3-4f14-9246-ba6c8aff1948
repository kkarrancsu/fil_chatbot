This is shown for the scenario of a duration multiplier function that\u2019s linear with a 3x slope, with a new average sector duration of 4 years (tan bands). For reference, this potential scenario is compared to \u2018no change\u2019 supply dynamics (blue bands).\n\n### Summary", "metadata": {}}}
