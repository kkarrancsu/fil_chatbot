A design where protocol fees are burnt will eventually lead to a token supply too small to support all the other token features, such as paying for service fees or staking. In other words, burning is good in the short term as it aligns token supply with protocol usage. However, in the long term, the network is expected to eventually reach a level of over-burning that will limit the growth of the network.\n\nThis issue is not a major concern in the short to medium term since the fees will be set to limit the risk of over-burning and because QRDO still has a large enough supply to accomodate a reasonable amount of burning. Nevertheless, this is an issue that needs to be closely monitored and may need to be readdressed down the line.\n\n**Attacks via Protocol-funded transactions**", "metadata": {}}}
