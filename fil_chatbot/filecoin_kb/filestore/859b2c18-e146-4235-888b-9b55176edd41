This illustrates the necessity of the multiplier for data storage. \n* A storage provider with Filecoin Plus deals is more competitive than CC or RD, but exploiting Filecoin Plus is the best strategy, if there is minimal cost associated with cheating (V1-exploit profile). \n* If exploiting Filecoin Plus is made more costly, through retrieval tests, or through levying a penalty conditional on the outcome of Filecoin Plus disputes, then FIL+ storage providing will become the rational choice. \n\nThese conclusions depend on the cost and income assumptions made in Table 1, as well as network state and token exchange rate. We invite the reader to explore how profits and losses change, depending on these assumptions, using [this interactive calculator](https://filspcostexplorer.streamlit.app/).", "metadata": {}}}
