This is shown in Fig. 2 above, where we observe the first Baseline Crossing in April 2021 when \"Total RB Capacity\" overtakes the \"Baseline Power\".) \n\nBaseline Crossing is when the network's storage capacity either exceeds or falls below the network's baseline storage target. The first baseline crossing, shown in Fig. 2, occured in [April 2021](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/filecoin-network-crosses-baseline-sustainability-target-for-first-time/) when the network's RBP exceeded the baseline storage target. This resulted in the network releasing maximum possible block-rewards per epoch.", "metadata": {}}}
