The softer SDM slope creates less incentives to terminate (Fig 3) as well as a smaller potential network RBP drop (Fig 1) when compared with a stronger slope, while still incentivizing longer term sectors, supporting supply dynamics, and helping to fulfill Filecoin's mission of being a long-term and robust foundation for humanity's data.", "metadata": {}}}
