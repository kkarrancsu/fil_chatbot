In other words, even though we expect the network to transition to Delegated Proof-of-Stake in the medium term, we focus the analysis on the Federated Proof-of-Stake.\n- We assume that circulating supply does not impact token price, as both variables are modeled independently.\n- - We assume that the staking inflows and outflows are not impacted by either circulating supply or the token price, as the variables are modeled independently\n- The service fees are paid in Dollars. Furthermore, the conversion between USD and QRDO occurs with some fixed slippage $\\gamma\\in[0,1)$. That means that, given a QRDO price $P(t)$, each dollar converted to QRDO  results in $(1-\\gamma)P(t)^{-1}$ QRDO tokens. \n- We also assume service fees and number of transactions are independent of all other metrics, such as token price, staking flows and circulating supply.", "metadata": {}}}
