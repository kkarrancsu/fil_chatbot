Here we focus on key metrics for Qredo's economy and discuss how the design and proposed parameters meet our goals of sustainability and token utility.\n\nWe ran a simulation with the same scenarios (token price, network usage, and staking sentiment), but now we forecasted the economic metrics for 3 years instead of 2 years. In addition, we used the following tokenomic parameters:", "metadata": {}}}
