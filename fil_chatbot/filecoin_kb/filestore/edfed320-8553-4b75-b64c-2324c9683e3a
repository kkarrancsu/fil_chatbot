This threshold depends on a single metric that we are comparing against. For instance, in the *fast requests* heuristic, the metric is the request duration. \n\nWe can interpret this problem as a search for univariate anomalies. In the case of the *fast requests* heuristic, we are interested in data points that are too low for the *\"normal\"* data distribution. Here, the threshold is the point below which we consider a data point *\"abnormal\"*.\n\nIn this document, we do not share the final threshold of each heuristic. If we did, the heuristic would be very easy to cheat! Instead, we discuss the process of getting to the final thresholds. In particular, we use two distinct methods, namely:", "metadata": {}}}
