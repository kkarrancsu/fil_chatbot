This can be easily done through the Qredo interface.\n\nCurrently, Web3 dApps interaction is the largest use case within the Qredo network. Currently, users of this service are primarily corporate and institutional clients.\n\nAll external transactions incur a service fee, making this one of the key income generation verticals for Qredo. \n\nThe network utilises a *Pay-as-you-go* fee model, in which users only pay for the (billable) transactions that they make. The service fee for each user is computed using a pricing curve which reduces the price as the total total amount of traded volume over the last 30 days, increases. The minimum fee per trasaction starts at $1 (or its token equivalent), and caps out at 1% per transaction. The figure below shows the cost curve based on the monthly billable volume.", "metadata": {}}}
