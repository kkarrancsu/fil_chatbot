The maximum circulating supply in the infinitely far future, tends to infinity. This means that $P^A_t=0$. Yet investors keep holding ETH. Can we design a better metric to explain this?\n\n## Expected Token lifetime dilution\n\n\nWhat will happen to token price infinitely far in the future, should not be the main concern of investors. \nA much more important question is what will hapen to token price throughout the entire time that they will hold the token.\n\nSuppose the investor plans on holding the token for $T$ years. We define the *Lifetime Diluted price*, $P^L_t$, as the Average token price throughout the $T$ years, under the assumptions that 1) There is a known schedule $S_t$ for how the circulating supply will increase, and 2) the market cap will remain constant. This is computed as\n$$ P^L_t=\\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T\\frac{C_t}{S_{t+t^\\prime}}dt^\\prime$$", "metadata": {}}}
