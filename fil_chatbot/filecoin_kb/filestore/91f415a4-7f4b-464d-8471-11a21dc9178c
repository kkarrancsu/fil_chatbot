Inspired by the traditional minting functions, we propose to have $\\alpha$ follow an exponential decay controled by a decay rate. We will test different decay rates to balance both the inflation rate and the staking model feasibility (for both validators and stakers). In particular, $\\alpha$ is defined as:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\alpha(t)=\\left(1-e^{-d\\cdot t}\\right),\\quad d>0\n\\end{aligned}\n \nHere, the rate parameter $d$ is a tokenomic parameter to be tuned. \n\n- **Release Rate Function, $r(t)$:** Similar to the vesting rate function, this function allows a share of the $\\mathsf{EcosystemFund}$ for distribution.
