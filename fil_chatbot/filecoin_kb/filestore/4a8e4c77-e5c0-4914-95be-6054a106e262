While the risk of sprawl remains there, a given L2 hierarchy could grow too large, absorbing too much demand from the rootnet. There are fewer direct levers to pull to attempt to control the sprawl. It is no longer possible to directly limit the amount of gas available for checkpointing, or to enforce minimum collaterals for the first level subnets.\n\nThe sprawling hierarchy would be effectively indistinguishable amongst all FVM messages. It is now FVM directly which represents a risk of gas sprawl. The only remaining lever available to control FVM-related sprawl, is to control the amount of gas available to FVM as a whole, creating different gas lanes for regular storage-related messages and FVM messages.", "metadata": {}}}
