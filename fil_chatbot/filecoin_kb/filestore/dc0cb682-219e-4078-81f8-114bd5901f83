This document presented an analysis of the possible economic impacts of the changes proposed by FIP-0057. These changes are about more accurately accounting for gas usage, which, in our opinion, is a pure engineering task; indeed, we believe it is in the network's best interest to have the most accurate accounting of gas we can estimate. If optimizing a network parameter would bring undesirable economic consequences, then the underlying economic mechanism would need to be revised. This should not, however, be a blocker for network improvement on the engineering side.*\n## Appendix.\n\n\n### Appendix 1. Proposed changes\n**Remark:** *This table was taken from [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0057.md), and presented in this document for convenience.
