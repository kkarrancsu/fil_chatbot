If the slope was made higher, % locked would be higher.\n- InitialPledgeLockTarget is 50%. If this was higher, % locked would be higher.\n- The above image corresponds to a new average duration of 3y. Longer durations lead to higher % locked.\n\n### What does the QAP projection look like?\n\nQAP projections are based on assumptions about raw byte power, renewal rate and FIL+ rate. The modeled relationship between these and QAP is documented [here](https://hackmd.io/@msilvaPL/SkapZkrdc). \n\nIn the supply simulations, the assumptions have variation +/-50% to reflect our future uncertainty. This leads to the following QAP trajectories for i) the \u2018no change scenario and ii) a central scenario of slope 1x, average duration 3y, and 50% InitialPledgeLockTarget:\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJRSQfcdi.png\">\n<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n\n### What will the effect on small SPs be?", "metadata": {}}}
