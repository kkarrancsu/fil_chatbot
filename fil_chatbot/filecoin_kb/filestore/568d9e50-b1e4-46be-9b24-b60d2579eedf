For instance, if we fix $k_2$ (i.e. look at the plot column-wise), we can see that the smaller the bandwidth exponent $k_1$ is, the more we reward longevity. This means that, in the long run, when $k_1$ is low, operators that are in the network for longer are more rewarded for the same amount of bandwidth contributed. Diversely, when $k_1$ is high, high-performers get larger rewards for the same amount of bandwidth contributed. Now, if we fix $k_1$ (i.e. look at the plot row-wise), we observe a similar trend, where increasing the exponent $k_2$ leads to an increasing gap between the 3 types of operators. However, the effect is not as considerable the impact of increasing the bandwidth exponent $k_1$.", "metadata": {}}}
