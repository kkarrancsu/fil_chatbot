This rate takes into account two of Qredo's KPI for network growth: TVL and number of validators. In particular, for some given maximum rate $r_\\text{max}$, such a function is chosen of the form:\\begin{aligned}\nr(N^\\text{val},\\mathsf{TVL})=r_\\text{max}\\left(b\\cdot \\min\\left(1,\\frac{\\mathsf{TVL}}{\\mathsf{TVL}_\\text{target}}\\right)^a+(1-b)\\min\\left(1,\\frac{N^\\text{val}}{N^\\text{val}_\\text{target}}\\right)^a\\right), \\quad a\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0},\\ b\\in(0,1).\n\\end{aligned}\nIn words, this means that as either the TVL or the number of validators approach their target, the release rate approaches the maximum possible rate $r\\max$. In the equation above, $a$ is a parameter that controls the growth towards that parameter, and $b$ is understood as a lever that gives prefference to either TVL or number of validators. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1VwbgqO3.png)\n\n\n\n### Reward distribution", "metadata": {}}}
