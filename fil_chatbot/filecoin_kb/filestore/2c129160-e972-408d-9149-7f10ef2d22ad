Assumption 2 means that miners are more likely to submit messages to the Mempool if their inclusion is profitable for (in expectation). In practice,  Assumption 3 holds relatively well over short periods of time (about a month). Lastly, Assumption 4 is relatively mild, and representative that, larger miners are more likely to spend more gas. \n\n\n\nFrom Assumptions 1 and 2 it follows that a message will be submited to the Mempool **with probability 1** if the base fee is $b_\\text{min}=10^{-16}$ FIL per gas unit. Otherwise it decreases with $v_m$.
