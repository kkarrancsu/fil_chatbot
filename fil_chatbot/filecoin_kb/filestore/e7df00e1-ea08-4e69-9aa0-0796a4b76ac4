As we can see from the time series of the token price (first plot), while there was a clear correlation between both tokens until June, 2022, this price correlation has noticeably dimished since. Notice, for example, that QRDO did not benefit as much from the market rally from the begining of 2023. Examining the time series of returns (second plot), reveals that the QRDO token is significantly more volatile than BTC. Lastly, we compute the [*beta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)) of QRDO with respect to BTC. Loosely speaking, *beta* can be understood as a measure of how sensitive the price of an asset is with respect to a reference market. Our computation yields a *beta* of $0.08$, which suggests that large changes in the price of BTC are not likely to signal significant changes", "metadata": {}}}
