In general, it is preferable to seal sooner rather than later. However the advantage is small. This is because multiple factors tradeoff to ensure stability. If SPs seal early they gain a larger multiplier and benefit from higher minting rate and time value of money. But those who seal later benefit from lower initial pledge per QAP. The overall effect is a balance that is designed to provide good outcomes for all scenarios. With specific reference to CC vs FIL+, as noted above, FIL+ is the more profitable. This is expected to remain the case after duration multiplier implementation. \n\n### Why the short lead time and concurrent rollout?", "metadata": {}}}
