H) The 1 year ROI, before gas and capex/opex. TheIn each panel the dotted line (15-Jan-2023) indicates when SDM is introduced on 15-Jan-2023. The average new duration is 5y, with 5x SDM. Other durations are shown in Appendix/Notebooks. In the New sectors CC-jump scenarios, where CC committed capacity (CC) power is terminated and re-onboarded, this happens on the same day the SDM is introduced.", "metadata": {}}}
