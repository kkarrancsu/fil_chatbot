Real FVM data will help us narrow down priors and assumptions and lead to more realistic and useful solutions that can be applied adaptively going forward.\n\n#### Primary goal: Understanding all hypothetical gas demand outcomes\n\nWe instead will spend most efforts on option 2.  This goal can be more precisely defined in terms of target/net-FVM-demand graphs. \n\nWe need to understand if the effects of a certain level $D_{FVM}$ of net FVM gas demand will be good for Filecoin or bad for Filecoin. To determine what is good and what is bad, we need to measure a given **target function**.\n\nA **target function** in this case is some measurable quantity that Filecoin stakeholders have agreed is a quantity that should be maximized.\n\n\nSome example of possible target functions to consider are (that have risen from different conversations with different community members):", "metadata": {}}}
