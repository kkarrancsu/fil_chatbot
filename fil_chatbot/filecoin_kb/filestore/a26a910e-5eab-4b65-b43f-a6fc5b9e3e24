Let the price of FIL = x1 ETH.\n- The smart contract tracks the price changes of FIL relative to ETH.\n    - If the price of FIL falls relative to ETH, the investor can mint more eFIL tokens to maintain the same collateral ratio with the same ETH deposit. This means that the investor does not risk losing ETH from their initial deposit just because of a FIL price drop. Additionally, the investor always has the option of unwrapping their eFIL tokens for ETH at the market price.\n    - If the price of FIL rises, the investor can either increase their ETH deposit or burn the required amount of eFIL tokens to maintain the same collateral ratio. Suppose the price at this point is x2 ETH. A strategy here could be to swap (x2 - x1) eFIL tokens to FIL, trade it for ETH, and add that ETH to the deposit. Therefore the investor would have made a profit of (x2 - x1) ETH.", "metadata": {}}}
