In the pessimistic combined scenario, the daily inflation rates are slightly lower, and the circulating supply grows slower than in the other scenarios. After the legacy vesting schedules finish, the circulating supply inverts, and its drops are sharper than the drops observed in the other two scenarios.\n\nWe can observe this effect in the inflows and outflows of the Ecosystem fund in Figure 3.3.1, with the pessimistic scenario leading at the same time with more tokens locked and fewer tokens released. This is caused by the combined effect of the Service Fee Model and the release function design.\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkVPXWit2.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyALXZit2.png\">", "metadata": {}}}
