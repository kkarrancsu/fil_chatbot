Smaller relative increases to status-quo mean that two competing forces, namely, the increase in multiplier vs the potential decrease in Fil+ onboarding due to increased incentive for CC, will determine the network KPIs. \n* Closing the gap between CC and FIL+ reduces the relative incentive to onboard Fil+ sectors and reduces the incentive to cheat.", "metadata": {}}}
