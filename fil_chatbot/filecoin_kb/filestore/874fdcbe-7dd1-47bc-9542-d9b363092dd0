Let $\\{\\tau^H_i\\}_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}$, $\\{ \\tau^L_i \\}_{i\\in\\mathbb{N}}$, denote the times between two occurrences of a high demand peak or low demand valley, as defined in section .. One can then model  the times at which  these peaks (resp. valleys) appear by sampling $\\tau^H_i\\sim\\text{Exp}(\\lambda^H(\\tilde{G}_t))$. This in turn can be combined with the previous two approaches in order to include a value of $\\tilde{G}_t>\\overline{G}$ every $\\tau^H_i\\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim}\\text{Exp}(\\lambda^H(\\tilde{G}_t))$ times. \n\n\n#### 5.2.2 Demand as a [Hidden Markov Model (HMM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)", "metadata": {}}}
