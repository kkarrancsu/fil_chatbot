Our results are shown in the figures below. Our observations confirm what is discussed above, indeed;\n\n- Indeed, **for the top 10% of messages by miner tip,** there is a significant difference between the distribution of miner tips from FEVM compared to the others; in particular, the **median** in this setting is about **an order of magnitude larger than the others**. \n- Furthermore,  we can see that all distributions have a long right tail.\n\n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkNaTDsx2.png)", "metadata": {}}}
