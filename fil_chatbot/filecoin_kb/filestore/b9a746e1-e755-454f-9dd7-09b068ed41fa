We should note that these APRs are not the real rates a Staker would experience over a year as every day the interest rate changes based on changes in TVL and the total rewards available. It simply encodes a \"synthetic\" annual rate experienced on a particular day. We should also note that this APR does not take into account protocol fees.\n- **Weekly rewards**: This is the amount of rewards in QRDO a staker would receive in a week, assuming they had staked the minimum amount (i.e. 2500 QRDO). This value is computed in a daily rolling window of 7 days.\n\n**Takeaways:**", "metadata": {}}}
