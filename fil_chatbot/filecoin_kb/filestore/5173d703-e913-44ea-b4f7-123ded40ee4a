For each parameter, we plot the metrics that are most impacted by the parameter. Once again, to make the report easier to read, we will detail the main takeaways at the top of each subsection and display the corresponding plots afterward.  \n\nThe plots in this section continue to show the average and standard deviations of each metric. The difference now is the source of variations. Now, we will fix a single tokenomic parameter and aggregate it across the other parameters and the various scenarios.\n\n\n### Tipping rate\n\nThe tipping rate corresponds to the percentage of service fees collected in USD that is converted to QRDO and locked in the ecosystem fund. For the parameter sweep, we used 3 possible values - 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4.", "metadata": {}}}
