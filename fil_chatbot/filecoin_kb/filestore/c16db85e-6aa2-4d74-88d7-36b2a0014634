Increased decentralization through Delegated Proof-of-Stake.\n2. Enhanced the role of QRDO as Qredo's utility token.\n3. More transparency and community engagement through open governance.\n\nThe end goal is to execute the vision of a truly decentralized custody network and to put the QRDO token at the center of Qredo's product. It is worth noting that, *currently*, the Qredo network is fully centralized (i.e., the validator nodes are run by the team).", "metadata": {}}}
