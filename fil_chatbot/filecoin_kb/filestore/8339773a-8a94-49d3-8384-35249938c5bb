In particular, the proposal presented here leads to a decrease in the Initial Pledge per GiB of quality-adjusted power added to the network (Fig 4C). Thus, with the same hardware, SPs can get a bigger share of rewards by committing to the network for longer. \u00a0In addition, the longer the network\u2019s average sector duration, the more pronounced this reduction of initial pledge per GiB is.\n\n## Appendix\n\n### Model design\n\nIn order to evaluate how this proposal would impact the network and Storage Providers (SPs), we designed a model that simulates the protocol\u2019s circulating supply contributions under changes to SP sealing behavior, duration multiplier mechanism, and altered Initial Pledge Target. For now we provide a short description of the model assumptions, aiming to provide a complete model specification and accompanying code in the following days:\n\nThe main assumptions to take into account are the following", "metadata": {}}}
