Under our modeling assumptions, we found that once the base fee is roughly above $10^{-10}$ FIL per gas unit, the block is dominated by SP maintenance messages. We also estimated the decay rate of the proportion of FVM messages, and visualized these proportions as a function of the base fee for several levels of total FVM demand. **An interesting conjecture, is that the block composition will ultimately depend on the strategy of the miner.**", "metadata": {}}}
