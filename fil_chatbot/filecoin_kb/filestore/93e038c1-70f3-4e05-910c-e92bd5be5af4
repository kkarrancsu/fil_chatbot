For built-in scaling solutions (such as sharding, or the original version of IPC), the Filecoin network would have direct tools available to regulate how much capacity is opened up by the scaling solution, not wanting to open up **too much capacity**, in a way  that would be harmful to Filecoin's best interests.\n\nCurrently, IPC is planned to be implemented fully as an L2 solution on FVM. This means there is less control available to regulate the amount of capacity opened up by scaling solutions. If the amount of supply that has been opened up becomes problematic, the only tool Filecoin has is to regulate FVM gas usage as a whole.", "metadata": {}}}
