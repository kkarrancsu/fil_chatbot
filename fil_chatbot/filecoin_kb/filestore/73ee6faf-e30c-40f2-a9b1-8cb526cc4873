It is not a matter of which level is better. Instead, we will do detection at both levels in parallel. \n\nAnother consideration is the detection techniques we plan to use. Since the initial version of the detection module has to be designed before Saturn has real active users, we start with a simple heuristics-based detection system, tuned with sensible assumptions about how users will operate with Saturn and the testing data we already have. The next section goes in more detail about these heuristics.\n\nAfter Saturn is launched and more data is collected, we plan to iterate on this simple system by improving the heuristics and experimenting with more sophisticated detection methods such as anomaly detection models, supervised models, and active learning models.", "metadata": {}}}
