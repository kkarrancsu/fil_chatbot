Here, \n* The 5/5/20 variant results in the largest decrease in circulating supply. \n* 5/5/10 and 2.5/2.5/10 can also decrease the circulating supply, but only if the FIP is compouned with an increase in onboarding. The effect also takes longer to manifest. \n    * If there is no associated increase in onboarding, the increased multiplier from the FIP competes with any hypothetical decrease in Fil+ rate onboarding to set the overall Network QAP, which affects circulating supply. This is observed in the light red and blue lines in the Pct. Decrease CS subplot in Fig 2.\n\n#### Incentives\nFig 3 explores the impact of the multipliers on pledge and Fil-on-Fil returns.  Consenusus pledge is directly proportional to circulating supply, and inversely proportional to Network QAP. Increasing multipliers increases Network QAP, and decreases circulating supply, meaning that pledge is decreased.", "metadata": {}}}
