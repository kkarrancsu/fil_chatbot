Specifically, this increases the onboarding rate by the 1, 1.5 and 2 PiB/Yr, respectively. Additionally, since this FIP aims to make CC onboarding more attractive by decreasing the ratio of QA multiplier for Fil+ and CC sectors, we simulate onboarding scenarios from the current status-quo that have decreased Fil+ sectors onboarded. This is modeled with a percentage decrease in Fil+ onboarding rate, computed for 0% decrease, 20% decrease, and 50% decrease to understand the directionality of the effect.", "metadata": {}}}
