In addition, having the possibility to pay service fees in USD is an important product feature since it increases the platform's usability. This is especially important for institutional clients as it simplifies their internal accounting and paperwork.\n\nAnother important feature of Qredo's business is that some institutional clients do not pay directly with the decentralized protocol. Instead, They sign a traditional B2B agreement with Qredo's LLC and the Qredo team is responsible for billing and collecting the fees. In this situation, fees are not collected algorithmically by the protocol and thus Qredo LLC must do an extra step to transfer the value being generated there into the Qredo network. Thus, the fee model must consider these two types of clients (clients *billed* by the protocol vs. clients *billed* by the LLC) and adjust the value transfer mechanism.", "metadata": {}}}
