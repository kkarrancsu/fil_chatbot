In response to this change, the locked pledge is expected to increase by x2 within 1 year, and the circulating supply reduce by 20%. \n\nIn Figure 1 (top), projections +3 years ahead show the future trend for (locked+burned)/supply, both for the central scenario, and in the case of no change. The central scenario restores the (locked+burned)/supply ratio to values close to the circulating supply dynamics observed in early 2021. \n\n**FIL-on-FIL return**\n\nIf we introduce a linear duration multiplier function, SPs still experience the right incentives in terms of FIL-on-FIL return. In other words, if SPs behave rationally and if we disregard the additional operational costs and cash availability, SPs are incentivized to continue to lock more FIL+ deals and to do it within longer sectors.", "metadata": {}}}
