However, the impact is not proportional. The marginal effect gets smaller as $q$ increases.\n\nIn addition, increasing the circulating supply will soften the impact on FFoR while decreasing the circulating supply will worsen the impact. But it is interesting to note that circulating supply does not have a significant effect on the % change in FFoR, with decreasing the circulating supply to half only leading to a marginal effect of close to 2%.", "metadata": {}}}
