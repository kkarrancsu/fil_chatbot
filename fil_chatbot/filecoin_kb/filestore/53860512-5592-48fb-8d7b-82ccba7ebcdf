As it can be seen,  there is a slight jump around $\\tilde{G}_t=1$,  which accounts for the peak on the histogram.  A table with the summary statistics of $\\tilde{G}_t$ is shown below:\n\n| mean \t| std \t| min \t| 25% \t| 50% \t| 75% \t| max \t|\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n| 0.010087 \t| 0.391897 \t| -0.973181 \t| -0.280465 \t| -0.058001 \t| 0.228362 \t| 0.999999 \t|\n\n\nThere are some interesting takeaways from the previous table. First, the mean is within the standard error (at a 95% confidence level) of 0. As we will discuss later,  having a mean-zero process for $\\tilde{G}_t$ is of importance to the overall health of the network. Furthermore, 75% of the time, the normalized gas usage is below 0.228.\n\n\n\n### 3.2 Conditional behaviour", "metadata": {}}}
