There are several possible choices for this function, but we consider  one of the form:  \n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nU_\\text{simple payer}(p) &:= -\\log(p)\n\\end{aligned}\nFurthermore, notice that the previous utility function can also be written in terms of demand by observing that $D$ is a *diffeomorphism* (differentiable and bijective) and hence invertible; i.e., for a given demand curve $y$, we can always write $p=D^{-1}(y)$. Below we plot this utility function as a function of price and demand. \n\n\nIn this utility function, the user's utility is inversely proportional to the base fee $b$. That is, the higher the base fee, the lower the user's utility. The use of the logarithm ensures that the utility function is concave, which is a desirable property for many economic models.", "metadata": {}}}
