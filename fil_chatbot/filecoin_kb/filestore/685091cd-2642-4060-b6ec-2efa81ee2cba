Examining the release rate factor $a$, we observe that such a quantity is negatively correlated to the APY.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZXCKJKh.png)\n\n\n\nIn addition, the APR increases with $b$, albeit slightly.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkWVCKkt2.png)\n\n\n\nAs for the max rate $r_\\text{max}$, the APR clearly increases with such a quantity, however, the rate of change dimishes as $r_\\text{max}$ increases.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJXusdZF3.png)\n\n\nRather unsurprisingly, increasing the validator's rewards rate will, naturally, decrease the APR for stakers (since this would, in turn, mean that they receive fewer rewards)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkS71ckF2.png)\n\n\nLastly, investigating the effects of tipping rate, we can see, that rather unsurprisingly, such a quantity increases the APR\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJaC0KJt2.png)\n\n\n## Conclusions and Finalising remarks.", "metadata": {}}}
