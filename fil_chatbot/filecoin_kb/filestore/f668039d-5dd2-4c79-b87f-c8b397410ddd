The larger the TVL, the lower the APR, as we have more participants sharing the fixed rewards vesting from the Staking Program Support fund. This is a common design that allows the participants to reach a consensus around the optimal APR for the value they bring to the network.  However, we want to make sure that the APR does not drop too much before the network reaches the ideal TVL rate.", "metadata": {}}}
