As a blockchain, it has a shared global consensus across the whole network.  The computation in Dfinity occurs on chain.  The protocol is called the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP).   \n\nDfinity uses a variation of PoS called Threshold Relay Nodes produce a random number that is used to select the next group of nodes that participate in consensus.
