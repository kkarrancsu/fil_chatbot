The discount will depend on the estimated costs of fiat-to-QRDO conversion and will be a key parameter of the service fee model.\n\nFinally, for the clients billed by the LLC, we need to consider another key model parameter - the tipping rate. The tipping rate is the percentage of fees paid by these clients to the LCC that will be \u201ctipped\u201d to the network. As Qredo\u2019s LLC is responsible for business development, client relations, and payment collection for these clients, they cannot pay the entirety of the fees back to the network. On the other hand, the clients are using the decentralized protocol and thus some value must be transferred. This split is encoded by the tipping rate.\n\n**The tipping rate and the QRDO discount rate will be defined in the second phase of this project.**\n\n## 4.
