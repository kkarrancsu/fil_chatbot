In simple terms, our goal is to understand if the effects of a certain level of net gas demand $D$ will be \"good\" or \"bad\" for the network, a set of users, etc.  In order to determine what \"good\" and \"bad\" is, we need first need to define a metric for this effect. We will refer to this metric as a **utility function**. In what follows. we consider several utility functions of varyiing complexity.", "metadata": {}}}
