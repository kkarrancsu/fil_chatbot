Note that here we assume that the total reward to be distributed is $R=100$.\n\nThe first conclusion here is that the choice of scoring function has a significant impact on the overall distribution of rewards among node operators. The following table illustrated this by reporting the minimum and maximum reward paid to a single operator and the [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient). Recall that the Gini index is a measure of statistical dispersion that represents wealth inequality within a group. It varies between 0 and 1, with 0 expressing perfect equality and 1 expressing maximal inequality.", "metadata": {}}}
