In the latter, validators stake tokens as collateral against dishonest behaviors, which, when detected, results in **slashing**\u2014a penalty in the form of collateral loss. The amount slashed is a proportion of the validator's total staked amount. In both cases, stakers stake these tokens in exchange of being part of the staking rewards program.  The specifics of these mechanisms, such as minimum staking amount, duration, and token unlocking mechanisms, will also be decided in the project's second phase.", "metadata": {}}}
