The value of these tokens is tied to the demand for the network's services and the holder's ability to provide these services efficiently. For example, Storage Providers in Filecoin must use FIL to onboard storage into the network, which allows them to collect fees from any clients' deals using that storage.\n4. **Governance Feature.** Governance tokens provide holders with voting rights in the network. They enable decentralized decision-making and control over the network's parameters or direction. The value of these tokens often stems from the influence they confer over a network's development and the potential future value of those decisions. MakerDAO (MKR) and Compound (COMP) are examples of this model. Token holders can vote on various aspects of the platform's operation and rules.", "metadata": {}}}
