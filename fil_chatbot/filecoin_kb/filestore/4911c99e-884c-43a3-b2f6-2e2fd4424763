Once such a model has been trained, we use it to classify our data, as shown in the figure below.

The plots of these histograms are shown below. As we can see, the conditional distribution of $\\tilde{G}_t$ given $D_t$ is a mixture of Gaussians\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YRD2i9J.png)", "metadata": {}}}
