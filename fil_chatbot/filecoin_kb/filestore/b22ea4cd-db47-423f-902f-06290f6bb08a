Below, we plot the historical volume of staking as well as its summary statistics. From there, we can see that such events represent an average volume of ~150K USD/week (since events occur on a weekly basis). Furthermore, this volume is well concentrated around its median, suggesting that the volume due to staking events is less volatile than the total transaction volume. We will discuss future staking mechanisms in a future writeup, however, it is worth mentioning that the network's plans to move towards a Delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm could, potentially, generate additional value-capturing opportunities.\n\n\n\n| ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1NcdS242.png)| ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJOkFH24n.png)|\n| -------- | -------- | \n| *Historical volume*     | *Summary statistics*     |\n\n\n\n\n### L1 Transactions (Ethereum)", "metadata": {}}}
