Possible extensions.\n\n### 3.1 Variable lane width. \n\nInstead of defining a fixed lane width $w_\\ell$,  we can alternatively use a mechanism that adjusts the lane widths based on the utilization rate of each lane. For simplicity, let's suppose throughout that $B_{\\text{target},\\ell,t}=w_{\\ell,t}/2$. We present two examples of how to implement this. \n\n\n**Example III.** Consider a scenario with only two lanes; one for the network maintenance, (say $\\ell=1$) and one for all FVM-related messsages ($\\ell=2$). Intuitively, we can expect the number of mainentance messages to grow with the network Quality Adjusted Power (QAP). Thus, one alternative in this case would be to make\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nw_{1,t+1}&=\\max\\left\\{w_{1,t}\\left(1+\\alpha \\frac{\\textsf{QAP}_t-\\textsf{QAP}_{t-1}}{\\textsf{QAP}_{t-1}}\\right), B_\\text{max}\\right\\},\\\\\nw_{2,t+1}&=B_\\text{max}-w_{1,t+1}.\n\\end{aligned}", "metadata": {}}}
