A value of $\\psi=1$ implies that all the rewards sourced for the Staking Model are distributed to validators, while $\\psi=0$ indicates that all rewards are directed to stakers.\n\n- **Minimum stake amount, $\\bar{s}^\\min$:** This paramater encodes the minimum amount of QRDO tokens required for Staking. Different protocols currently impose different minimum staking amounts; for instance, Cardano requires a minimum of 8 ADA, while Ethereum sets a minimum of 32 ETH. \n\n- **Minimum stake duration, $\\tau^\\min$**: This is the minimum number of days that tokens must be locked in order to be considered \"staked\" and receive rewards. The staking duration in other protocols ranges between 0 to 180 days, with longer durations enhancing both network security and circulating supply.", "metadata": {}}}
