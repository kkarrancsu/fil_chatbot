Additionally, the L/CS trajectory, an important quantity when assessing the consensus security of the network, is also on a downward trend. These decreases in TVL and power also result in the pledge decreasing, which results in an increased projected Fil-on-Fil returns (FoFR).  This is a resilient property of the network that is automatically activated to encourage more investment into the network.\n\n![mcmc_inputs](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk5VoOEF6.png)\n*Fig 1: Possible trajectories for Onboarding, Renewal, and Fil+, given 120 days of historical data.*\n\n![mcmc_power](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJsTc_4ta.png)\n*Fig 2: Forecasted network power.
