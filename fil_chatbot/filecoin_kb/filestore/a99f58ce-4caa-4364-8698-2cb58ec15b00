In A) the annualized percentage return on pledge invested is shown for a one year Filecoin Plus sector sealed within the next year, for scenarios of no change, and changing the Initial Pledge Target to 30%, 40% or 50%, with a linear multiplier with slope 2. The quartiles reflect uncertainty in future onboarding, renewals and the Filecoin Plus rate, in addition to variation arising from sealing dates within the next 12 months. In B) the annualized percentage return over three years is shown under behaviors of i) 3x1yr_reseal: sealing, expiring, resealing, expiring, then resealing, compared to, ii) 3x1yr_extend: sealing, extend, extend, compared to iii) 1x3yr: making a single 3 year commitment, which leads to a higher locked-in return. In C), the Initial Pledge in FIL/GiB (of quality-adjusted power) is shown, for the no change scenario, and scenarios where average sector duration of 1, 3 or 5 years is combined with a 40% Initial Consensus Pledge target multiplier.*", "metadata": {}}}
