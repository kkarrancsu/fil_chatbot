This is one of the most important components of the circulating supply as it depends both the Storage Providers' (SPs) behavior and the network state.\n\n\n## Model assumptions\n\nWhen designing this model, we focus on daily aggregate network dynamics. In order words,  we avoid complex simulations that capture individual SP behavior and, instead, model aggregate network metrics and mechanisms using sensible approximations.", "metadata": {}}}
