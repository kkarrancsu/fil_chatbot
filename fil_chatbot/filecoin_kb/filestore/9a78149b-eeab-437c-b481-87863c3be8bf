Introduction\nIn this report, we recap the details of Filecoin\u2019s minting and address the following questions: \n1. What is Filecoin\u2019s forecasted minting rate?\n2. Will total minting reach simple minting? \n\nWe use Monte-Carlo methods to forecast minting rates for the next five years. Using the forecasts, we show that if current trends in onboarding and renewal rates continue, the median estimate when total minting reaches simple minting is on 2026-03-18, with quantiles Q5 and Q95 falling on 2024-12-10 and 2028-02-20, respectively. We additionally run ten counterfactual scenarios to gain further insight into how total and simple minting are related. We observe that as raw-byte power and renewal rates are scaled up, the date when total minting will approach simple minting is extended further into the future.", "metadata": {}}}
