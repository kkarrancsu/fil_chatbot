The ROI of a certain investment is defined as the investment's net gain divided by the initial investment.\n\nIn Filecoin, Storage Providers (SPs) seal sectors for a certain amount of time and get rewards from the network by maintaining the sector active and providing the corresponding proofs.\n\nFor the FoFR, we ignore the price of Filecoin in USD (i.e., we are computing all costs and rewards in FIL tokens) and we also ignore all the operational costs such as the price of the hardware and the electricity to maintain the hardware running. So, we can say the FoFR is an optimistic approximation of the real return of SPs.", "metadata": {}}}
