A) The Circulating Supply defined as Minted + Vested - Locked - Burned. B) The aggregate number Locked Filecoin from different pledges and rewards. C) The ratio of Locked to Circulating Supply. D) FIL minted per day, E) Network quality adjusted power (QAP) trajectories. F) Network Raw Byte Power (RBP) trajectories. G) Initial Pledge per 32 GiB sector onboarded. H) The 1 year ROI, before gas and capex/opex. TheIn each panel the dotted line (15-Jan-2023) indicates when SDM is introduced on 15-Jan-2023. The average new duration is 2y, with 2x SDM. Other durations are shown in Appendix/Notebooks. In the New sectors CC-jump scenarios, where CC committed capacity (CC) power is terminated and re-onboarded, this happens on the same day the SDM is introduced.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BypO8QX5s.png)", "metadata": {}}}
