Notice that, in practice, the decision implied by the previous equation is difficult to make, as it depends on the (clearly unknown) base fee $b_s$ at a later recover epoch $s$. In light of this, we choose to monitor $b_t$ such that.  \n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Penalisation}_j(p) <b_tg_w.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nWhile having a $b_t$ for which the previous bound holds does not necessarily mean that a (rational) miner would instead get penalized, it is likely valuable to understand this threshold.\n\nHere, we define penalization as 3.5 days of expected block rewards. Thus, given that there are, on average, $\\lambda=5$ blocks per epoch, and there are 2880 epochs in one day, this becomes \n\n$$\\text{Penalisation}_j(p):=3.5\\times2880\\times\\rho_j\\times\\lambda\\times R\\times \\underbrace{\\left(\\frac{\\text{partition}}{\\text{all partitions miner J}}\\right)}_\\text{:=$1/N_{p,j}$}.$$", "metadata": {}}}
