In terms of the multiplier options considered, 5/5/20 has the greatest and most uniform effect, since the increase in multipliers is large enough to dominate plausible changes in onboarding behavior (that were simulated). The 5/5/10 and 2.5/2.5/10 options are more nuanced due to the competing forces.\n* Power and Minting", "metadata": {}}}
