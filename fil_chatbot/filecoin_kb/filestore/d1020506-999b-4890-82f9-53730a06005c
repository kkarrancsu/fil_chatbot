The approach presented below relies on several approximations. It will not necessarily be very accurate, but we produce it in the hopes that it can provide a ***Ballpark*** estimate of these gas equivalences. \n\n#### Ethereum Vs. Polygon\nPolygon started as an EVM-powered, PoS-based Layer 2 solution to the Ethereum scalability issue. Thus, given that Ethereum switched to a PoS mechanism since *The Merge* (September 2022) and that Polygon is built on top of the EVM, we will assume, for the sake of simplicity, a 1:1 equivalency in terms of `Gas_used` for transactions in both networks. Notice that this is indeed the case for simple transactions, such as `transfer`. Notice that this is only in terms of gas units used, and the other factors that affect gas fees (i.e., base fee and token price) are generally not the same in both networks.", "metadata": {}}}
