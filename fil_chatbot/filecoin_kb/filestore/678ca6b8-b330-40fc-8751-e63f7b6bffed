This is not expected to be a very large risk, since the effects of FVM on gas demand may not be felt immediately upon launch, but may accumulate over a longer period of time. \n\n\n## Modeling approach [WIP]\n\n\n\n \n\nAny economic modelling of network behaviors will involve a number of assumptions, which will never be perfectly accurate. Our goal is to maximize the accuracy of our assumptions, while beign constrained by computational complexity and explainability of the models. \n\nWe propose foscusing our modeling efforts into (1) demand, (2) target function reaction, (3) uncertainty, and (4) solution exploration and testing. In order to make our models as useful as possible, we believe it is necessary to regularly (and often) interact with other stakeholders from Product, Engineering and Research.", "metadata": {}}}
