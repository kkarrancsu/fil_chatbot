Gas as an aggregate\n\n\n### 3.1 Basic exploratory analysis\n\nWe begin by examining the aggregate gas consumption per block by observing the `base_fee`  from tipset height 2005320 through 2094600, corresponding to block data ranging from July 22nd, 2022 through August 22nd, 2022. This data consisted of 88644 entries. \n\n\nRecall that base fee $b_t\\in\\mathbb{R}_+$ at block $t\\geq 0$ is given by $$b_t=b_{t-1}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{8} \\frac{G_{t-1}-G^*}{G^*}  \\right),$$ with $G_{t-1}$ the gas consumption at block $t-1$ and $G^*:=5\\times 10^9$ the target gas consumption. Defining the *normalised gas consumption at block $t$* as $\\tilde{G}_t$, given by  $$\\tilde{G}_t:=\\frac{G_t-G^*}{G^*}, \\quad \\tilde{G}_t\\in[-1,1],$$ it then follows that \n$$\\tilde{G}_t=8\\times\\left( \\frac{b_t-b_{t-1}}{b_{t-1}} \\right).$$\n\n\nCleaning up the gas data (making sure that gas is obtained by block, and not tipset, removing empty entries, etc) and plotting it, gives the results shown in the figure below.", "metadata": {}}}
