Considering this milestone, we provide a situational report of the Filecoin network in this report. Given the current state, we begin by forecasting what the network state will be in one year. This is done using two methods:\n1. Using forecast trends\n2. Developing some possible scenarios of SP onboarding behavior.\n\nWe find that using both approaches, the network will trend toward shrinkage.\n\nNext, we examine the onboarding necessary for the network to catch up to the baseline in one year and compute the investment needed to achieve that level of onboarding. We additionally examine whether there are incentives to delay onboarding. Action items for network maintainers are then discussed in the closing remarks. \n\n\n\n## Simulations\n\n### MCMC", "metadata": {}}}
