In particular, we define the total renewed power $R^{RB}(t)$ as the sum of renewed power coming from the following four groups of sectors:\n\n* $R^{RB}_1(t)$: 1st-time renewals\n* $R^{RB}_2(t)$: 2nd-time renewals\n* $R^{RB}_3(t)$: 3rd-time renewals\n* $R^{RB}_+(t)$: sector renewing for the 4th time or more (aka the *oldy renewals*)\n\nNow we have everything in place to define the equations for the scheduled expirations. Here we just need to use the estimated power onboarded, the estimated power renewed, and the sector duration ($d:=$ 1 year):\n\n* $SE^{RB}_0(t) = O^{RB}(t-d)$\n* $SE^{RB}_1(t) = R^{RB}_1(t-d)$\n* $SE^{RB}_2(t) = R^{RB}_2(t-d)$\n* $SE^{RB}_+(t) = R^{RB}_3(t-d) + R^{RB}_+(t-d)$", "metadata": {}}}
