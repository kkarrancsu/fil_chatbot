Furthermore, this mechanism could increase the demand for the tokens.\n\nThe *Locking* mechanism will depend on the stage where the Qredo network is concerning decentralisation. In particular, for the FPoS model, only *stakers* will be required to lock a number of QRDO in exchange of participating in the staking rewards program, while there is no need for validators to lock tokens. For the DPoS model, however, both *stakers and validators* will be required to lock tokens.\n\n\n## Technical details and initial recommendations\n\n\n### Technical details\n\nWe now present some technical details on the components of the staking mechanism.\n\n#### Source of rewards", "metadata": {}}}
