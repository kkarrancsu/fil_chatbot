Mathematically, this can be written as a sigmoid function of the form\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nS_\\text{sp}(p;a,b)&=\\left[1-\\left(1+e^{-a(p-b)}\\right)^{-1}\\right]N^{-1}, \\quad a,b\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+},\\\\\nN&=\\left[1-\\left(1+e^{-a(b_\\text{min}-b)}\\right)^{-1}\\right],\n\\end{aligned}\n\nwith some unknown parameters $a,b$, representing the decay rate of the sigmoid, and the point where half of the miners are not willing to submit messages. Once again, obtaining a \"real\" version of $S_\\text{sp}$ is not possible, as this would require to have an intimate understanding of each SP, their risk preferences, OpEx's, etc. Instead, we construct a *family* of survival functions by parametrising the values $a,b$.", "metadata": {}}}
