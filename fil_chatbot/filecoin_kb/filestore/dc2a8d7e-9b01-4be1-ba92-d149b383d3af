Since the speed performance scoring function is quadratic, a variation in speed performance of $d$ leads to a variation in rewards of approximately $d^2$.\n\nFinnaly, to incorporate the base badwidth that all node serve by default, we consider this baseline to be 25% of the monthyl cap of 45 TB. On top of the base bandwidth, we assume a traffic demand ratio that a node of 100 Gbps would get after applying the 45 TB cap.\n\nThus, the final formula is the following:\n\n$$I \\times (11.25 + R \\times C) \\times (\\Delta S)^2$$\n\nwhere:", "metadata": {}}}
