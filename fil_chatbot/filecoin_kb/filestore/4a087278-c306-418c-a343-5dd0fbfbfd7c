In this case, protocol revenue comes from $\\mathtt{penalty}$, $\\mathtt{batchfee}$, and $\\mathtt{overestimationfee}$ and excludes $\\mathtt{basefee}$. \n\nThe simulation framework, mechaFIL, simulates gas burned by taking the mean of daily burn over a historical window and linearly extending that to forecast the future. Following this approach, we compute over the same window the percentage of gas burn attributed to base_fee.  The median value is 54%, meaning that 46% of gas burn is attributed to the other sources previously mentioned.", "metadata": {}}}
