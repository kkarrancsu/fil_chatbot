A priori, it is clear that an increase in base fee will in turn present an increase in protocol revenue. \n\n\n\n\n**Circulating supply.**\n\nBecause of the EIP1559-like transaction fee mechanism utilized by the Filecoin network, an amount equal to `gasUsed` $\\times$`baseFee` is burnt at every epoch. Circulating supply is also affected by the minted amount $\\text{Mint}_t$ at such an epoch, as well as the amounts of tokens that are locked, $L_t$ (due to, e.g., onboarding) and unlocked (due to, e.g., sector expirations and completed vesting periods), $U_t$ at the epoch $t$.", "metadata": {}}}
