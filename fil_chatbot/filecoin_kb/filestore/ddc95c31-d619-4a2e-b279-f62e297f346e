First, this pool of tokens is split between Validators and Stakers. Then, for each group, the tokens are further split among individual contributors based on factors such as total staked amount, reputation, active participation, etc. The exact distribution is controlled by two score functions, namely the **validator score function** and the **stakes score function**, which will be defined in phase 2 of this project.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"350\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1uLNyLIn.png\">\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
