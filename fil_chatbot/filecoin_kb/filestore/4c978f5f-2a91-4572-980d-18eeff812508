Notice that, clearly, $G_t\\in[0,2G^*]$. From here, it can be seen that $b_{t+1}$ increases linearly with $G_t$. It is not difficult to show that increasing (resp. decreasing) the amount of gas consumed by 1 unit of gas, will increase (resp. decrease) the `baseFee` at the next epoch $b_{t+1}$ by $\\delta b_{t}:=\\frac{b_t}{8G^*}$, tokens per gas unit.  \n\n\n1. A priori, we would expect the average base fee to behave as follows:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJcJ-fYUs.png)\n\nindeed, higher demand will likely cause an increase on the average base fee, however, after some point, given that not all user will have the same *demand profile*, such a function will tend to stabilize.", "metadata": {}}}
