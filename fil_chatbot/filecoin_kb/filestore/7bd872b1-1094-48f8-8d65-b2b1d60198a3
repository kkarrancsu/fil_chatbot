This means that each forecasting step corresponds to a day and the forecasted metrics correspond to the value we expect to see at the end of that day.\n* We use the current pledge metrics (i.e. known scheduled expiration in pledge) to model known active sectors and we estimate pledge metrics coming from future onboardings and renewals using the same assumptions as ones used in the network power model.\n* Sector duration is a constant provided as a tunable parameter.\n* We ignore storage deal collateral when computing the total locked FIL.\n\nBesides the inputs from the other models, this model receives some inputs from the current state of the network:\n\n* $\\textrm{known_scheduled_pledge_release_vec}$ (vector of FIL): total FIL locked as initial pledge collateral that is scheduled to be released each day\n\n\n## Notation", "metadata": {}}}
