Setting the adjustment factor to be the ratio of the base fee of each lane to the overall base fee renders the costs in both models identical. This result shows that while the mechanisms differ in their approach, they capture the same principles and behaviors.\n- The adjustment factors serve as valuable indicators of the relative congestion in each lane, giving a proxy for network demand and congestion. The factors may help determine if a lane is busier or less busy compared to the rest of the network per unit of gas, which can be a key factor in decision-making.", "metadata": {}}}
