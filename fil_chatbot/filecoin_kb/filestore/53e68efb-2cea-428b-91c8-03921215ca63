In the following subsection we describe our choice of model and parameters in full detail. \n\n#### Rationale.\n\nWe begin from the observation that there is a clear, linear relation between the amount of gas used by M&O messages and network *Raw Byte Power (RBP),* as shown below.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryCT1iton.png)\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1PFl_W2n.png)\n\nWith this in mind, one can use linear regression to estimate the amount of daily gas required by M&O messages as a function of RBP to be of the form:\n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathsf{Total \\ daily \\ gas\\ used\\ M\\&O}_t=2632.09\\times \\mathsf{Network\\  RBP}_t-9609,\n\\end{aligned}", "metadata": {}}}
