Let us examine the supply dynamics first. \n\nIf a large proportion of SPs leave or terminate the network, this causes the minting rate to decrease due to decreased RB power. Simultaneously, tokens become unlocked because of pledge release from terminations, lack of renewals, and no new onboarding, causing the circulating supply to increase. However, the drop in QA power also results in network QAP crossing the baseline function. The increase in circulating supply is balanced by the QAP baseline crossing, causing the pledge to increase initially but then drop (due to an exponentially growing baseline). \n\nRewards are distributed proportionally to an SP\u2019s share of the total network QAP. As SPs terminate or leave the network, the remaining SPs\u2019 share of the total network QAP increases, creating a strong economic incentive for remaining SPs to maintain or increase storage commitments to the network.", "metadata": {}}}
