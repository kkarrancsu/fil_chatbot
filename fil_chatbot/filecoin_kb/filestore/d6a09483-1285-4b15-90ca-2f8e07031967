We have previously used a simple mechanism for understanding such relationships [here](https://hackmd.io/@cryptoecon/B10RGzlHo). The key assumption is defining some probabilistic distribution describing the value that users are likely to give to a given transaction, or how much a given user would be willing to pay for gas. Such a distribution may be fitted from existing gas usage data, but would be much improved after considering real FVM gas usage data. With these distributions, modeling different mempool sizes as inputs, it is possible to compute the resulting base fees.\n\nThe same tools allow us to examine the total network revenue as a target, once we are able to compute the base fee corresponding to a given level of demand, that can be combined with the amount of gas used to compute total network revenue.", "metadata": {}}}
