This can include the value that is captured by them not being front-run or sandwiched by an arbitrager.\n\nSimilar to the case with the rollup mechanisms, it is critical to ensure that the renvenue to the drand system is greater than or equal to the costs, in order to make the service a sustainable one for node operators.", "metadata": {}}}
