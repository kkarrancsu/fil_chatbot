As it can be seen, either approach seems to capture the \"bulk\" of the dynamics quite well, however, they do seem to struggle to capture those exceedingly high values.\n \n \n \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/R0fSrfK.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/w0unJkc.png)\n\n\nOnce either model is implemented, can then recover a model for $\\tilde{G}_t$ by iterating over all $i\\in\\mathcal{M}$ and adding all the obtained values of $\\tilde{G}^i_t$, i.e., by setting $\\tilde{G}_t=\\sum_{i\\in\\mathcal{M}}\\tilde{G}^i_t$.
