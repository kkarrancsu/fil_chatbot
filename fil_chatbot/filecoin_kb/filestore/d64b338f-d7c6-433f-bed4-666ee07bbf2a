The exponent for the bandwidth is $k_1 = 0.5$ and the exponent for uptime and speed performance ratio is $k_2=2$. The choice of exponents comes from the desire to distribute rewards more evenly among operators, while penalizing in a meaningful way the operators that not achieving a good uptime and download speed performance. In other words, we want to see a network that shares the load in terms of bandwidth, while maintaining high performance standards.\n:::\n\n#### Penalty multiplier\n\nFrom the bounds' analysis done in a previous section, we got an acceptable range for the penalty multiplier. Given the range (from 5x to 10x), we picked the values 5x and 7x to include in the analysis.", "metadata": {}}}
