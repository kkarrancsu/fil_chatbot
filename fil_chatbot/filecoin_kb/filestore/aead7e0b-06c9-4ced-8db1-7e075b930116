Indeed, while **batching methods** (i.e., `ProveCommitAggregate` and `PreCommitSectorBatch`), as well as `PublishStorageDeals` tend to have the largest 50% and 70% quantiles** (meaning that, in terms of frequency, they tend to be the ones with the largest miner tips), the maximum tip due to **FEVM or Other** categories is about an order of magnitude larger than the others, with the largest miner tip examined having a value of **12 FIL in a single message** (with `cid=bafy2bzacebzkveaurmnyuzqk2xwuilvcnmp65us43wed3a3r4euumiv4olmzy`). \n- It is also worth noting that FEVM is also the group of tips with the **smallest** 25% and 50% quantile. Furthermore, its 75% quantile is of a comparable magnitude as the others.", "metadata": {}}}
