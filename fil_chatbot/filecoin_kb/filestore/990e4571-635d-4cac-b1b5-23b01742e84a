This can be done by taking a linear combination of these utility functions. An example is shown below. \n\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{Total\\ utility}=w_1 \\mathsf{HODL's\\ utility } +w_2 \\mathsf{user\\ utility }-w_3 \\mathsf{network\\ burden }+...\n\\end{align}\nwhere $w_1,w_2\\dots$ are some given weights determined by the agreed relevance of the terms.\n\n##### Target-$D_{FVM}$ graphs\n\nA main outcome of this part of the research project is then to understand the possible positive or negative impacts to Filecoin that FVM launch could have.", "metadata": {}}}
