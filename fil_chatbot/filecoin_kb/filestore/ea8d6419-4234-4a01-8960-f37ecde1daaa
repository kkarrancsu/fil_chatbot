Forecasting Minting Rates\n\nTo forecast the range of possible minting rate trajectories, we use a Monte-Carlo approach to forecasting the range of inputs that affect minting, namely the raw byte onboarding rate and the renewal rate. Raw Byte onboarding power and sector renewal rate are modeled as a Bayesian time series using a [Seasonal with Global trend model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rlgt/vignettes/GT_models.html) trained on historical data to create forecasts of these inputs over the simulation window. The forecasting uses the previous six months of onboarding and renewal trends to train the model. Daily forecasts of Raw Byte power and renewal rate are computed using 4 MCMC chains, with 5000 samples from each chain and a warmup of 5000 samples. Further details of this modeling approach are detailed [here](https://hackmd.io/@cryptoecon/BkytBgbIs?type=view#Method-1-Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo-Simulations-for-Baseline-Crossing).", "metadata": {}}}
