In periods of **sustained** high demand, however, where it will take a long time to get some messages included on chain, some users *might* then need to submit a larger tip to get their messages included. This presents two questions:\n\n1. Which users will need to do this?\n2. What will the increase in average gasPremium be?\n3. Do we expect a profile as in the previous figure, or something different?\n\n\n**Protocol revenue**", "metadata": {}}}
