The goal is to have a mechanism that adjusts based on real-time data without necessitating frequent manual recalibrations. In this section, we introduce a \"Lane Adjustment Mechanism\" designed to fulfill this need. This mechanism employs mathematical formulas derived from observing the relationship between the amount of gas used by M&O messages and the network's Raw Byte Power (RBP). Let's delve into the specifics.", "metadata": {}}}
