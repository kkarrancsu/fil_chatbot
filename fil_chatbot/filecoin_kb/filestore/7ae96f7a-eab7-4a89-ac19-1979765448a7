A similar procedure as before produces the plot below. As we can see, in this setting, smaller miners reach the limiting value faster. \n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJKs_oLOi.png)\n\n\n\n\n#### 2.3 third result: A Threshold for intentional faults.\n \n\n\n*** Summary**: If the base fee is around 70 nanoFIL per gas unit for over a day, it is cheaper for a miner to get penalized*\n\n\n\nA hypothetical scenario that could hurt the network is when the base fee becomes so large that an SP would rather get penalized than send a PoSt. Given a partition $p$, this happens whenever the cost of getting penalized, together with a later recovery of the partition, is smaller than the cost of sending the PoSt. More precisely, at a given epoch $t$,", "metadata": {}}}
