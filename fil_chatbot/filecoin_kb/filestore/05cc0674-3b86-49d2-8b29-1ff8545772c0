The latter could, for instance, be set at $B_\u2113^* = B^*_\\ell / 2$. Under this setup, opcodes of class $\\ell$ can use up to $B_\\ell$ gas units (i.e., it holds that $G_{\\ell,t}\\leq B_\\ell$ for any epoch $t$). This ensures better control over base fee changes, however, might increase the probability of a message failing to be included whenever one of its opcodes fails to be included, and, intuitively, it makes a less efficient use of the block space.\n\n\n### 3.2 Multiple base fees vs. adjusting factor", "metadata": {}}}
