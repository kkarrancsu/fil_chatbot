Given some class $i$ and a price $p$, and denoting by $G^i$ the amount of block space utilised by messages of class $i$, the Implicit Demand (ID) is defined by the following mapping\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\np\\overset{\\text{ID}_i}{\\mapsto} G^i(p)\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\ni.e., this demands takes a price $p$, a class $i$, and assigns it a proportion of the block space, $G^i(p)$. \n\n# Appendix A2. Quantities that are likely to be affected. \n\n\n\n\nWe begin by identifying the network quantities that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by these changes in demand.  \n\n\n### A2.1. Quantities. \n\n**Gas consumption.** \n\nPerhaps the most directly-affected network quantity after the introduction of the FVM will be the gas consumption (`gasUsed`) $G_t$. An increase (resp. decrease) in demand for block space will increase (resp. decrease) gas consumption.  *Apriori*, it seems reasonable to assume that the FVM will increase demand for block space.", "metadata": {}}}
