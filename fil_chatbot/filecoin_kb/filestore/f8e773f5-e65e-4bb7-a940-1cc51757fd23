Cianci, CryptoEconLab, May 2023\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of two staking mechanism designs for the Qredo network, in line with their strategy for decentralization. \n\nInitially, we examine 'synthetic staking', which is currently employed by the network, and subsequently delve into two increasingly decentralized consensus mechanisms that Qredo aims to integrate in the future: a  Federated consensus mechanism (which we will call Federated Proof-of-Stake (FPoS)), and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanisms.\n\nSubsequently, we introduce the key components of a staking mechanism design, which include the source of staking rewards, the method of their distribution, and the enforcement of locking and slashing mechanisms.\n\nFollowing this, we engage with the more intricate details of these components, including an exploration of the numerous parameters that make up the complex design framework of a staking mechanism.", "metadata": {}}}
