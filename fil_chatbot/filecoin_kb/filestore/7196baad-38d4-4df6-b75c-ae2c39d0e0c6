Here, we call the $i^\\text{th}$ path $R_{i}(t)$ for $i=1,2,\\dots,N=2000$. \n\nWe model RBP in the following form \n\\begin{aligned}\nR_i(t) &= R_0e^{X_{i}(t)},\\\\\nX_{i}(t)&= X_{i}(t-1) + \\xi, \\quad \\xi\\overset{\\text{iid}}{\\sim} \\pi,\\\\\nX_i(t_0) &= 0,\n\\end{aligned}\nwhere $\\pi$ is assumed to be a stationary distribution of the difference of logs in the RBP function, starting st some `CUTOFF` date.\n\nIn particular, we construct $\\pi$ by fitting a Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) to the dataset\n\n$$L_{i}=\\left\\{\\log\\left(\\frac{R(t+1)}{R(t)}\\right)\\right\\}_{t=t_\\text{cutoff}}^{t_0},$$", "metadata": {}}}
