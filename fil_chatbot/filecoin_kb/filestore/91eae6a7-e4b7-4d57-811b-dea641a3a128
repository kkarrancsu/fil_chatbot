Saturn recalculates the new collateral amount\n2. Saturn sends a notification to the operator warning that the commitment period has ended and informing them of the new collateral amount.\n3. Operator decides whether they wish to renew or terminate:\n   1. If the operator wishes to terminate:\n      - They can withdraw the funds without penalties.\n    2. If the operator wishes to renew:\n      - They can update their time commitment - if nothing is stated here, we assume the same period\n      - They will update the collateral (add more if the new requirement is higher)\n4. After a predefined time (TBD), Saturn will check collateral:\n   - If the collateral is smaller than the required, Saturn will stop sending requests and no more rewards will be paid.\n   - If the collateral is higher of equal to the required, Saturn will continue to send request to the operator and distributing rewards", "metadata": {}}}
