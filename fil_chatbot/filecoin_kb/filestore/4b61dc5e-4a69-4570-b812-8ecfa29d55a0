This is because the outflow due to locking pledge is significantly higher than the outflow due to burn of PSD messages, when onboarding deal power.\n    * DDO frees up block space, enabling a higher throughput for onboarding power onto the network. With current estimates of gas savings and onboarding rates, the chain will be able to support ~300 PiB/day of deal power. This would require ~350M FIL of investment into the network.", "metadata": {}}}
