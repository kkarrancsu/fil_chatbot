Opportunity costs may be overcome by adding resources to their network but. given limited resources, a choice between compute or storage may be required.  At the same time, offering compute may be a way for some storage providers to diversify their income streams.  \n\nTechnical expertise is another factor (and cost) for compute providers to consider.  If additional overhead in the form of specialized software (e.g. CUDA, TensorFlow) is required, that play a part in the provider\u2019s choice to participate as a compute provider.     \n\n## **Value Flow**\n\nCloud compute is already well established in the marketplace.  One existential questions for Bacalhau is what value can be added above and beyond AWS EC and Google Kubernetes, for example.  One of the biggest advantages of Bacalhau is the number of data sets already on the Filecoin network.", "metadata": {}}}
