In other words, for each sector currently active or onboarded, at the expiration date, we consider that it may be renewed only once. If it is renewed, we move the expiration date forward and we don't consider further renewals. This assumption is needed so that we can model the process in a single go.\n* Filecoin Plus sectors have the same renewal rates and sector lengths as other sectors. This is something we may want to relax after we do a deeper analysis of renewal rates and sector lengths split by sector type.\n* Since we currently don't have the known scheduled expirations measured in quality-adjusted power, we approximate it using a provided rate of Fil+ power. This is another assumption we want to remove when we can extract the real data.", "metadata": {}}}
