In particular, we will focus on the effects that the tipping rate, the protocol fee rate, the validator reward share, the staking rewards vesting decay, and the three paramaters of the release function ($a$, $b$, and $r_\\text{max}$) have on critical output quantities, such as circulating supply, yearly inflation, validator rewards, Ecosystem fund balance, staking rewards, and APR.\n\nFor each combination of input-output, we examined two key measures, namely:", "metadata": {}}}
