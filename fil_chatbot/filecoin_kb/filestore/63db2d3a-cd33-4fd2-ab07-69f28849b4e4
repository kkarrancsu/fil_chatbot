The takeaways are threefold:\n* If the token price is high, a lower multiplier than 10x is sufficient. \n* High costs mean a higher multiplier is needed, and as does lower revenue, all else equal. \n* The minimum value sufficient to incentivize data storage, under the typical scenarios considered, ranges from 3x to 30x. Due to heterogeneity in costs, the ability of SPs to generate deal income, and token price variance, there is no single minimum multiplier. \n\nThese data points suggest having a multiplier of at least 10x, and likely higher, closer to 30x, is needed to ensure data storage with a single multiplier across the whole range of plausible network operating conditions. Conversely, from historical data we know 10x is already a sufficiently high-powered incentive \u2014 this is evident from the growth and saturation of the FIL+ daily onboarding rate to ~90%, shown in Figure 1.", "metadata": {}}}
