It was first implemented by Dan Larimer, and it is the consensus mechanism in platforms such as *BitShares, Steem,* and *EOS.*\n\nDPoS seeks to streamline the decision-making process within a blockchain by minimizing the number of nodes involved in such a process. Instead of every network participant being involved in the process, DPoS elects a fixed number of *delegates (or witnesses)* to create blocks and confirm transactions, with the rest of the network participating in a democratic voting process to select these delegates.\n\n#### How does it work?", "metadata": {}}}
