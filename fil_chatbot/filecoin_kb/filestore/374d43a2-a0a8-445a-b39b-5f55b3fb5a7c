A clear consequence can be seen in the change in behavior of total network revenue upon the release of hyperdrive. The sudden increase in capacity lead to a steep decrease of the base fee, which meant the total amount of token burn to process transactions decreased after hyperdrive in June 2021.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/koAXQLw.jpg)\n\nIn a world without 1559, miners may see this decrease in total network revenue as a \"bad deal\", **they may choose instead not to use all the new capacity provided by the new technological advance, but instead restrict the capacity, and release it only according to existing demand, in a way that would maximize their revenue**. EIP 1559 therefore requires miners to fill a block size that has too much capacity, relative to current demand, or else base fee starts to drop.", "metadata": {}}}
