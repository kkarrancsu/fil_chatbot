Which describes the underlying transaction fee mechanism of each lane. \n\nEach of these design choices has its own set of parameters; however, regardless of the choice of design, one also needs to decide on the number of lanes and the (initial) lane widths.\n\n\nIn what follows, we delve deeper into these aspects.\n\n \n\n## Diving Deeper\n\nWe now discuss these design choices in more detail. A table summarising that discussion is shown below.", "metadata": {}}}
