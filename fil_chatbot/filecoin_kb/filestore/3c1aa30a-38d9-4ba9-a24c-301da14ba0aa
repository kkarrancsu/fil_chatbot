In generality, the tendency of the Filecoin network to establish an equilibrium state is affected by multiple factors, including exchange rates, cost of production, and initial pledge dynamics, among other factors.*\n\nIn this cycle, block rewards get diluted as SPs onboard more power, causing returns to decrease. This results in offboarding power, which then increases reward concentration and induces more onboarding. \n\nThe network shock scenario examined here is a case of this cycle, with the primary difference being that the changes to the network happen instantaneously rather than gradually.", "metadata": {}}}
