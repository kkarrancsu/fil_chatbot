Furthermore, constructing and identifying suitable reputation and  voting mechanism (for DPoS) requires careful attention. These parameters should be meticulously selected to optimize incentives, boost participation, and guarantee network security.\n\nIn this study, we detailed a general structure for these factors and  offered some parameters selection guidelines that we believe align with Qredo's future plans. We plan to delve deeper into analyzing and testing specific parameter choices in future studies. Our forthcoming report will also include an extensive investigation of the voting and reputation mechanisms.", "metadata": {}}}
