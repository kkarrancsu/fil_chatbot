The base fee then evolves according to the  EIP 1559 rule:\n$$r_{t+1}=\\left(1+c\\frac{B_t-B^T}{B^T}\\right)r_t,$$\nwhere $c=1/8$. Furthermore, the block size is restricted to $B_t\\in[0,2B^T]$\n\nThe rationale is that base fee should adjust according to network usage demand. If the current block size is larger than the target block size, then base fee should increase to relieve congestion, and if current block size is smaller than the target block size, then the network is being underutilized and base fee should be lowered.", "metadata": {}}}
