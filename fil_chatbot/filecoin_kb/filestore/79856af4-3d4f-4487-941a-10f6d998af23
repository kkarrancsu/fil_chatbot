Most machine learning use cases are probabilistic and, therefore, challenging to validate.  The ultimate vision of Bacalhau is to support both deterministic and probabilistic applications.   The technical challenge of how to validate probabilistic use cases remains.  Project Bacalhau proposes a unique approach (see below under **Trace-based Validation**)\n\n**Actors**\n\nThere are typically four actors in CoD systems: (1) Clients who wish to have compute on a public or private dataset (2) Compute Providers who receive a fee to process data; (3) Storage Providers who have public or private data on their storage devices.  Note: this is largely confined to Bacalhau except for TrueBit, which accesses data through Ethereum Storm; although, Ethereum Storm does not have nearly the storage assets of Filecoin; and (4) Validators, who confirm the computations for the system.  \n\n## Overview of Ecosystem", "metadata": {}}}
