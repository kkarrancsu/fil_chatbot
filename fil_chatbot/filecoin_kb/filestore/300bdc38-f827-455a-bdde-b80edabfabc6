Suggested function: linear with slope 2. This acts as an incentive for long-term storage by assigning higher quality-adjusted power (QAP) and therefore rewards to storage providers (SPs) who commit to longer sector durations.\n2. Updating the current sector duration limits, from 180-540 days to 1-5 years. This primarily supports the aforementioned longer durations being incentivized.\n3. Adjusting the [Initial Consensus Pledge target multiplier](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_mining/miner_collaterals/), from 30% to a higher value of 40 or 50%. This intends to create long-term-aligned total value locked (TVL) dynamics to support stable and predictable conditions for SP returns.", "metadata": {}}}
