Fig. 1 shows the relevant supply metrics.\n\n![case1](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJfEA9SIT.png)\n\n*Fig 1: The difference in circulating supply and L/CS trajectories with DDO.*\n\nWe observe that there are minimal changes to the supply statistics.  That is because burn is a small percentage of $\\mathtt{net_outflow}$. Outflow from the circulating supply has two components:\n\n$$ \\mathtt{net_outflow = locking + burning} $$\n\nFig. 2 shows various perspectives of gas burn on supply statistics. Fig 2A shows the percentage of FIL burned as a percentage of the total circulating supply. Fig 2B shows the percentage of daily outflow attributed to burn, while 2C shows the daily outflow attributed only to the base_fee component of burn. \n\n![attrib_basefee_burn](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyR0f5SUT.png)", "metadata": {}}}
