By the same token, if no upper bound smaller than one is enforced, a similar situation can happen with the other lane (as it would, effectively, give it an arbitrarilly small target). \n\n\n\n## 3. Alternatives\n\nWe now briefly discuss some alternatives to the proposed mechanism. These alternatives are explored in much more detail in this [document](https://hackmd.io/vmi9ROQeTqefuVDDvy1jYg?both).", "metadata": {}}}
