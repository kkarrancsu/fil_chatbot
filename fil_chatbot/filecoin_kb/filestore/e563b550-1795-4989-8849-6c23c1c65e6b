All sectors experience a drop of around 50% in annualized FoFR at the start of the simulation when compared with the baseline scenario (which is the scenario with no duration multipliers and an average sector duration of 1 year).\n\nFor the 1-year sectors, the initial pledge is the same. Thus, the drop happens because the entire network is growing at a faster rate, the sector's share of QAP drops faster than the baseline, and the total rewards get smaller. For the 3-year sectors, this effect is compounded by the larger initial pledge required for the additional duration.", "metadata": {}}}
