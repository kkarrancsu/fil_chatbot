Real BLS signatures work over elliptic curves and use genuine bilinear pairings, not simple multiplications as shown here.\n\n\n### Verifiable delay functions\n\nA Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) is a cryptographic primitive that requires a specified amount of sequential computational time to compute and can produce a unique output. This means that, even on parallel computational architectures, the function cannot be significantly sped up. However, once a solution is found, it can be verified as correct very quickly.\n\n### Time-lock encryption", "metadata": {}}}
