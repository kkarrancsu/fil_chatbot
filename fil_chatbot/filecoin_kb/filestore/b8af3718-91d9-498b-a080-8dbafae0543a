This additional 10 million tokens removed from circulating supply corresponds to a reduction in yearly supply inflation of 1 percentual point. This result is consistent with our [Sensitivity Analysis](/4k7Eg5vaRoun78RnIT6sLA).\n- On average, increasing the tipping rate by 10 percentage points results in less 980 thousand USD untipped over the course of 2 years.\n- In the combined base scenario, a tipping rate of 30% allows the network to reach an equilibrium in the flow of the Ecosystem fun after 2 years. This equilibrium will occur when the QRDO-denominated service fees locked in the Ecosystem fund cover the rewards released on a given day. Since rewards are always capped at the `max_rate`, if the QRDO-denominated service fees keep growing,  this equilibrium will eventually be reached.", "metadata": {}}}
