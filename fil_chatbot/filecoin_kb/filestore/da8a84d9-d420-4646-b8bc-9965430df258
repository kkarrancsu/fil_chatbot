DFinity uses a cross-blockchain bridge to connect the Ethereum network with Dfinity\u2019s Internet Computer.  The bridge allows ERC-20 to exist natively on Dfinity\u2019s network.  The bridge (Terabithia) enables cross-chain contract communication, asset mirroring and transfers across different blockchains. It is built on Starkware, a\u00a0forked version of Ethereum scaling tool and will enable contracts on both blockchains to communicate.  Anyone can mirror and use any Ethereum asset on the Internet Computer and vice versa.", "metadata": {}}}
