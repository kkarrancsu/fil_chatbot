In Filecoin, simple minting decays at a rate of $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{6yrs}$, which corresponds to a 6-year half-life.\n\nThus, the total number of tokens emitted via baseline minting at time $t$ is independent of network power and follows the equation below:\n\n$$M_S(t)=M_{\\infty S}\\cdot(1\u2212e^{\u2212\\lambda t})$$\n\n\nOn the other hand, baseline minting, $M_B(t)$, depends on network power and aims to align incentives with the growth of the network\u2019s utility. The minting function still follows an exponential decay, however, it now decays based on the *effective network time*, $\\theta(t)$. The equations are as follows:", "metadata": {}}}
