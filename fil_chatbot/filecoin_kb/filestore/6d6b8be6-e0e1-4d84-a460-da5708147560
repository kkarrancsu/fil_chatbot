Setting key tokenomic paramaters\n\nDuring the first phase of this project, we proposed a set of new tokenomic mechanisms, including two new [Fee Models](/v5r6y8a_TE6NtouVHmPnmA) aimed at increasing token utility and a [Staking Model](/Xh_biTXNS8mpG5M_rMfKbg) to support Qredo's introduction of a federated Proof-of-Stake consensus. \n\nThere, we defined the broad strokes of how the mechanisms would work and left some specific parameters undefined.
