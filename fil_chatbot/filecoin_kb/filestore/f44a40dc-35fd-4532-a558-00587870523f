This available FIL is then distributed among the operators based on their relative performance.\n\nTherefore, the reward pool is a key design choice as it ultimately controls how much is being paid to operators and how investment into Saturn is distributed over time.\n\nDuring the design of the reward distribution component, we ran a [simulation](https://hackmd.io/@cryptoecon/SJIJEUJbs/%2FMqxcRhVdSi2txAKW7pCh5Q#Reward-pool1) to test two possible implementation for the reward pool. In the end, we proposed to use the *growth reward pool* design as it had some advantages over the *constant reward pool*.", "metadata": {}}}
