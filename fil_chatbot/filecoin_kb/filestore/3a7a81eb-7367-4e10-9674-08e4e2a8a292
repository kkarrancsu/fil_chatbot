This FIP proposes increasing the QA multiplier for CC and RD sectors from 1x to 5x and FIL+ sectors from 10x to 20x. \n\nOur approach is to simulate the effect of this change on the Filecoin economy using [mechaFIL](https://github.com/protocol/filecoin-mecha-twin/tree/policy_update).  The policy change is simulated for all sectors, meaning that new sectors onboarded and renewed after the policy introduction date will receive the new QA multipliers. \n\nTo explore the design space further, we explore several variations of QA multiplier schedules from the FIP 833 proposal. Table 1 outlines the QA multiplier schedules that were simulated.", "metadata": {}}}
