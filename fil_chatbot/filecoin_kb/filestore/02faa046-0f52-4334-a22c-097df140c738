In addition, it distinguishes itself from other self-costody solutions by offering enhanced convenience for signing transactions and interacting with Web3 applications compared to cold wallet providers like Ledger.\n\nTo achieve this, rather than relying on traditional private keys, Qredo adopts a *Multi-Party Computation* (MPC) architecture, which enables collective signing and validation of transactions, elevating the security measures for users' assets. The  Qredo network operates as a Layer-2 blockchain that can seamlessly connect with Layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, providing an independent infrastructure to manage transactions and facilitate interactions among users.", "metadata": {}}}
