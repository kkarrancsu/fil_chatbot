Furthermore, it can be seen that in 75% of the cases, the contribution to gas usage by non-control plane messages is below 0.053. This is further explored in the picture above (right), where we plot the histogram of the total weight for control-plane messages and the others.\n\n\n\n### 4.2 Top methods", "metadata": {}}}
