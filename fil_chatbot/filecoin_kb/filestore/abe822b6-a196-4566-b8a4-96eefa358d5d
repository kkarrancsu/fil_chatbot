In other words, with supra-linear functions, we are rewarding more the high-performers at the expense of the low performers.\n\nIn addition, the direct multiplication functions tend to lead to a higher concentration of rewards among high performers, when compared with the linear combination function. The only exception is the all sublinear, which has a lower Gini than the two most concentrated function among the linear combination group.\n\nThere is another different in the dynamics between the linear combinations and the direct multiplication functions, which is illustrated in the next two plots. Here we see the total payout given to each node operator against the share of bandwidth they provided.", "metadata": {}}}
