The differences come in part due to the fact that some transactions in Qredo are not billable and, thus, do not generate fees. An alternative could be to charge a fixed, nominal amount for each transaction (notice that, in this setting, the fees do not need to be equal across different transactions).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJRswQoNh.png)\n\nOther potential avenues to capture revenue and utility is to generate demand for \"Qredo-native\" transactions by e.g., incentivising L2-native transactions (over L1), as well as  capturing revenue from them. In addition, ecosystem growth and interaction with other protocols (e.g., DEXs) could also be an avenue to generate and capture future value.\n-->", "metadata": {}}}
