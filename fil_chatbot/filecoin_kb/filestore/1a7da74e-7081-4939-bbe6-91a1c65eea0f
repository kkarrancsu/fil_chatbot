Note that these two design choices are studied on the remaining subsections.\n\nThe next plot shows the distribution of the daily payout to operators. We can see the distribution for each operator type and for each combination of $k_1$ and $k_2$.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyRf4xiXs.png)\n\nThe first observation is that some payouts are zero. This happens in days when the operators are accumulating the balance required to cover future penalties.\n\nSecondly, as expected, performance has a significant impact on the payout to operators, with high performing operators getting higher rewards, followed by the normal operators, which are followed by the low performing operators. In addition, the exponents of the scoring function has a meaningful effect on how different are the payouts between the three operator types.", "metadata": {}}}
