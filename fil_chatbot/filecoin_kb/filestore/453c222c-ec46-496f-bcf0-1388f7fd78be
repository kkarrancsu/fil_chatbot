Running a L1 node is a more demanding operation than running a L2 node, both in terms of hardware requirements and service expectation. They are the ones serving requests directly to end-users and processing all the requests coming to Saturn. On the other hand, L2 nodes form swarms around single L1 nodes and serve as an extension of their cache. They are home machines, with low hardware requirements, that can go offline as they please.", "metadata": {}}}
