External transactions**\n\nThe first use-case is to allow clients to interact with Web3 dApps built on the L1 networks supported by Qredo. This means that clients can use Qredo as their custodian for initiating transactions with other Web3 services. Qredo achieves this by being the only MPC-based custodian that integrates with [MetaMask Institutional (MMI)](https://metamask.io/institutions/).\n\nAfter setting up the integration, if a user wants to submit a transaction to a DeFi protocol, they only need to initiate it using the MMI browser extension and then Qredo manages the transaction signing and approval.\n\nThe image below illustrates an example with AAVE, the largest DeFi Lending Protocol.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"700\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1LXCMt4h.png\">\n\n*Source: [MetaMask Institutional](https://metamask.io/institutions/)*\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
