As it can be seen, there is not a particularly high correlation between any two variables, however, there is some non-negligible correlation among the top three methods.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/g8humhi.png)\n\n\n\n\n## 5 Proposed models\n\nWe now propose several models based on the previously described data. While we aim at implementing such models in this report, we postpone their validation and comparison for the next report, which aims at completing task 2 in the [research plan proposal](https://hackmd.io/-SPCa6L7Sm-MK0liGX4Jww).\n\n\n\n\n### 5.1 Modelling gas as a whole.\n\nWe begin by presenting several ideas on how to model gas as its own process (i.e., without looking at each component). We remark that this is not an exhaustive list and that several components presented herein can be combined. \n\n#### 5.1.1 Simulating gas from the kernel density estimator.", "metadata": {}}}
