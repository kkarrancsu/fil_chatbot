Now, to get the *exact value of each new TB of bandwidth*, we only need two values:\n\n1. **The total cumulative bandwidth set by the baseline as the goal for the network**. To get this value, we assume that, 12 months after launch, the network aims to collectively serve 300TB per day. We also aim to have a linear growth in the total bandwidth being served each day. Thus, the total cumulative bandwidth after 12 months is $\\sum_{t=1}^{360} \\frac{300t}{360} = 54150\\text{ TB}$.\n2. **Total reward pool**. Protocol Labs will put forward an initial pot of FIL to quickstart Saturn. This initial pot is meant to last 12 months, time when the network is expected to develop and start getting paying customers. The exact value is not yet confirmed. However, for the sake of the calculator, we are assuming a total pool of 800k FIL.", "metadata": {}}}
