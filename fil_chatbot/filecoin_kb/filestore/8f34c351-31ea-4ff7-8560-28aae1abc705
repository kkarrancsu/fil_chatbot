However, to achieve this vision, the tokenomics underlying the network and its native token need to adapt, which is the reason why the Qredo Team partnered with CryptoEconLab to revamp the tokenomics of QRDO.\n\nThis collaboration was designed to encompass two main phases - the draft phase and the tuning and validation phase. The idea was to provide the general framework for the new tokenomics earlier and collect feedback before delving into the details of tunning and validating its key parameters.\n\nThis report is the main by-product of the first phase. Here, we provide an analysis of how the network functions now and detail some of the changes related to tokenomics that are expected to occur in the medium to short term.", "metadata": {}}}
