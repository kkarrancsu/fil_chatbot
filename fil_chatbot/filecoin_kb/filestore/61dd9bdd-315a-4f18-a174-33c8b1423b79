We keep the gas burn due to $\\mathtt{basefee}$ zero, as in Case 1 - this is a consequence of the assumptions of Case 2. Fig 4 shows the effect on supply for the FIL conserved case defined, 1.1x, and 1.2x the FIL conserved case.  The increased rates are in units of RBP; at the current FIL+ rate of ~92%, this translates to a 9.2x increase in deal onboarding rate.\n\n![case2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJn-75B86.png)\n\n*Fig 4: Changes to the supply statistics in Case 2.
