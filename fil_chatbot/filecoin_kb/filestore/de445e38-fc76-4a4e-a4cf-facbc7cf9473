Conclusions and future steps. \n\n\n\nWe have presented two bounds on the base fee that is worth monitoring. \n\nOn the one hand, we have shown that, for current values of block rewards, etc., it is not profitable for miners to submit any messages of their own once the base fee is above 20 nano FIL per gas unit. On the other hand, we have shown that it is more profitable for miners to get penalized for a sustained base fee of 70 nanoFIL per gas unit.", "metadata": {}}}
