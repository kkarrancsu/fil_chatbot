There are obvious limitations to this assumption (unavoidable accidents for instance). So perhaps much higher weight, $w_k$ must be given to violations that are not accidental, but malicious. \n1) Slashing policy: How much of the collateral should be slashed when a violation occurs? (should in principle depend on the violation weight $w_k$).\n2) In principle all the collateral can be slashed, doesn't have to be a fraction of it, because the total collateral adjusts to market dynamics. If this is too high an amount to be slashed then people will commit fewer violations, which will bring the slashing amount to a more reasonabe price.\n3) Collateral updating: What if a subnet is active and then $C_t$ increases? Do they become inactive until they pay up?", "metadata": {}}}
