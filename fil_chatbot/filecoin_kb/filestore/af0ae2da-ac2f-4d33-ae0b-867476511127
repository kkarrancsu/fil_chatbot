The counterfactual in this instance is shown in Figure 3. This shows Regular Deals would be around 1.5% of total current raw-byte power had their growth continued. This suggests even had the high initial growth rate of Regular Deals been maintained, it would be much less than the current Verified Deal level of data storage at around 12%.", "metadata": {}}}
