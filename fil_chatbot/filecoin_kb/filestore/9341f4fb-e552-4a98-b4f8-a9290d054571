They are a synthesis of a collection of several sources (including my [own --admittedly limited-- knowledge about randon-number generation](https://moodlearchive.epfl.ch/2020-2021/enrol/index.php?id=15466)), and as such, there could be small inconsistencies and errors here and there, but I write them in any case in the hopes it is useful to understand their project. \n\n## Introduction\n\nDrand is a *distributed randomness beacon for distributed systems.* There are a few key components of that sentence that are worth exploring in more depth. \n\n### Why do we need randomness?\n\nRandomness is inherent to several fields of science and engineering. A need for randomness  shows up:\n- In real life, for loteries, random jury selection, etc.\n- In crypto protocols, such as leader election\n- In statistics and modeling science", "metadata": {}}}
