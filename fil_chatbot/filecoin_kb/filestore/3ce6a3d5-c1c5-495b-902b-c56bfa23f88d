In the long run, this component will be the main source of Validator rewards.\n\n\nAll tokens stored in these two funds will be locked (and thus not part of the circulating supply). The protocol will manage the number of tokens available for distribution through two key functions that will be designed in the second phase of this project:\n\n- The **vesting rate function**, which controls the number of vested tokens in the Validator Reward Fund available for distribution\n- The **release rate function**, which controls the number of tokens available for distribution from the Ecosystem Fund.", "metadata": {}}}
