This mechanism works by artificially increasing the cost of aggregate batched proofs when network demand is low. This makes it irrational to batch proofs for your sectors at low demand. Once network demand crosses a given threshold, the cost of batch proofs becomes lower than that for single proofs, and it becomes rational to batch. Therefore the batch balancer releases the batching technology only when there is enough network demand to make this desirable.", "metadata": {}}}
