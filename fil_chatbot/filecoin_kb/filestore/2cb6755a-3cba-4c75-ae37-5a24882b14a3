A proportion continues to be burnt until the obligation is gradually paid off. \n- The fraction not burned is distributed the ordinary way between immediate and vested release rewards.\n- The mechanism can be generalised, so that on top of repaying the protocol through burning the amount of shortfall taken, an additional fee could be charged. This can be included if further analysis indicates it is a necessary property. \n\n\n## Actor State\n\n### Miner Actor State\n\nMiner actor state tracks one new field: `shortfall_fee`:", "metadata": {}}}
