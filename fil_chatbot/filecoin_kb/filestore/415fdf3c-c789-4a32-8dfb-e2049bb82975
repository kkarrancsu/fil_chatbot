The current circulating supply is roughly 405 M FIL, and it is increasing at a rate of about 0.5M FIL/day (from starboard).\n* It is worth mentioning, however, that these values are only harmful if the base fee consistently oscillates around them for an extended period (e.g., more than a day). Having a brief (several epochs) spike in some of these values is not necessarily concerning.", "metadata": {}}}
