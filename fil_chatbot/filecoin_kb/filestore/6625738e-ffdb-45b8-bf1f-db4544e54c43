However, there is no free lunch and this would also require careful design and testing to ensure its safety and reliability. We also remark that is also not immediately clear for us at the CEL how technically challenging the implementaiton of such a mechanism would be. \n\n\n\nThe rest of the writeup is organized as follows. We introduce the proposed model in Section 2. In particular, we argue how a simple Transaction Fee Mechnism (TFM) with gas lanes can be constructed as an extension of the EIP1559 TFM. In Section 3 we discuss several extensions and generalizations to the proposed model. We present a critique of the proposed mechanism in Section 4, and mentioned some related works in Section 5. \n\n## 2. Model.", "metadata": {}}}
