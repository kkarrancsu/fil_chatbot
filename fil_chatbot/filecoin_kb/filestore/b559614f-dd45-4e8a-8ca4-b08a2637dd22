We can understand this by examining what happens when $B_t^T$ is close to (but above) zero, yet still the evolution rule requires it to keep decreasing, as $\\Delta T_t\\Delta B_t<0$. In this case we would have $0<H(\\Delta T_t\\Delta B_t)<1$, which means $B_{t+1}^T$ will get closer to zero than $B_t^T$, but will never go below zero.\n\n\nWhile we allow the target block size to be dynamic now, we shouldn't allow it to go above the current target block size, $B^T$, as this is chosen to be the largest target block size we can consistently process. Therefore we need an evolution rule that prevents the dynamic target block size from going above $B^T$. There are two possible solutions to this:\n\n#### Conditional statement evolution", "metadata": {}}}
