Validation Layer\n\nA key challenge is designing a financial incentive system where participants report honestly about their computations and financial commitments.  Detection of cheating is one approach; however, that can be difficult with machine learning algorithms that are not deterministic.  If suspect transactions are relatively rare, Validators will not be rewarded often.  \n\nAnother approach in use is a reputation layer. TrueBit developed an interesting approach they call game-based verification. In fact Golem uses TrueBit game-based verification and reputation. Bacalhau\u2019s proposal optionally includes a unique verification method (described below). \n\n**Trace based reputation layer**\u00a0-", "metadata": {}}}
