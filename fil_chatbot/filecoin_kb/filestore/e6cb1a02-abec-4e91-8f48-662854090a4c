Appendix\n\n### Method 1: Markov Chain Monte Carlo Simulations for Baseline Crossing \n\n[comment]: <> (Future predictive posterior distributions for rates of onboardng, FIL+, and sector extensions are estimated from historical data. Samples from these distributions are used to propagate uncertainty to power forecasts. These are in turn used to generate trajectories of the minting rate, initial pledge and ROI.)\n\nWith this method, which is used to generate the results and analysis in the main text, we use a mechanistic statistical model ([github](https://github.com/protocol/filecoin-mecha-twin), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mechaFIL/)) to forecast economic metrics of the Filecoin economy. \n\nThe mechanistic model relates inferences or counterfactual assumptions about future onboarding and extension rates to the total rawbyte power, circulating supply components, and derived microeconomic quantities.", "metadata": {}}}
