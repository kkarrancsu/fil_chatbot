They essentially function as \"access tickets\" and can be compared to a subscription or a software license. Their value often lies in the exclusivity of the service they grant access to. For example, a token might offer access to a unique data set or a specialized blockchain-based service. As an example, Basic Attention Token (BAT) uses this model. Users hold BAT tokens to access premium services in the Brave ecosystem.\n2. **Staking Feature.** Staking is used as a form of collateral or 'stake' in a network. Users lock up their tokens in the network to participate in the network and receive rewards from newly minted tokens. The value of these tokens often comes from the potential earnings from staking. Ethereum 2.0 is the most known example of this model, where ETH holders can stake their tokens to secure the network and earn rewards.", "metadata": {}}}
