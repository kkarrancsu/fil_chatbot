Saturn's orchestrator module: a centralized service that will make test requests to operator nodes in other to measure their performance in terms of download speeds and uptime.\n2. Operator nodes: every time an operator node processes a request, they will log the request (along with some related stats) and send it to the orchestrator.\n3. Client websites: content publishers using Saturn to accelerate their online distribution will have Saturn code running in their applications, which will log metrics about each user accessing their content. Note that this data will only be available after Saturn onboards clients to network.\n\nSince there are no feasible solutions for trustless verification of content delivery, we cannot assume that the data Saturn receives from its operator nodes is correct. These logs can be doctored, either by hacking Saturn's code to directly edit the logs or by using a bot to make \"fake\" requests.", "metadata": {}}}
