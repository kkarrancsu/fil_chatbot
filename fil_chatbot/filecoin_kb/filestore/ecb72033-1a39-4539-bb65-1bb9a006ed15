The lower the token price, the more tokens will be locked from service fees. This balancing mechanism is super important! As the economy experiences hard conditions due to low token prices, the mechanism reduces circulating supply while, at the same time, increasing the long-term pool of tokens available for the Staking Model.\n- Usage also has an impact on the fund balance, with more service fees leading to more tokens being locked. This effect is slightly offset by the tokens burned to cover protocol fees, where more transactions lead to more tokens burned.\n- Staking sentiment has an inverse impact: higher TVL leads to higher release rates, which leads to lower fund balances.", "metadata": {}}}
