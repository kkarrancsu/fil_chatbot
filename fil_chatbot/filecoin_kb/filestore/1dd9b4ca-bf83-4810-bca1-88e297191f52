This is not expected, but it is necessary to consider. \n\nDiscussion of the factors and potential impacts are set out below, with accompanying simulations, alongside a modification of the current FIP. \n\n## Impact of SDM in each regime\n\nConcretely, what is the impact of being in the Investment Conservation regime where a duration multiplier reduces data onboarding compared to the Data Conservation regime?\n\n### Methodology\n\nWe forecast network power, minting, pledge, and SP ROI (before fees) using [mechaFIL](https://github.com/protocol/filecoin-mecha-twin), sweeping across a variety of SDM multipliers under both the data onboarding conservation and investment conservation regimes.", "metadata": {}}}
