This approach results in greater costs because on-chain L1 execution costs more gas.  The L2 fee is itself limited by the L1 gas block,  Moreover, large L2 data (e.g., NFTs) cannot use Optimism because L1 is limited by the size of the blocks that can be validated.  In contrast, a transaction requiring so much gas that it couldn't even fit into an Ethereum block is still possible on Arbitrum.   \n\n***Boba Network***\nThe Boba network uses Optimism\u2019s (non-interactive) rollup but shrinks the waiting period from seven days to only a few minutes by giving liquidity providers incentivized yield farming opportunities.  Boba uses a swap-based onramp, fast exit, cross-chain bridging and other features to enable this speed; however, note that liquidity providers may not be willing to cover large transactions.", "metadata": {}}}
