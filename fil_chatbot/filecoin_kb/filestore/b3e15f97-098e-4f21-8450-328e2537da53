The multiplier is halved every six months until it reaches 1.0 in two years.\n* **Option 3** - All new power after policy implementation becomes 10x.\n* **Option 4** - All new power after policy implementation gets a multiplier depending on when it is onboarded. The multiplier is reduced linearly from 10.0 to 1.0 over the course of 24 months to be direclty comparable to **Option 2**.\n\nFig. 1 shows the various scenarios of Fil+ multiplier changes considered.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ79IDW32.png)", "metadata": {}}}
