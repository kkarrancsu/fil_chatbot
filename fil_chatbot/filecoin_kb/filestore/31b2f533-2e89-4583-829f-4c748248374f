Storage has a direct relationship with the rate of requests that hit the cache, and\n2. Hitting the cache is equivalent to exceeding the speed performance threshold.\n\nNote that we assume that the relationship between storage and the cache-hit rate is logarithmic. We also assume that the max. storage in the slider (50TB) leads to an almost perfect cache-hit rate (90%). Concretely the formula is:\n\n$$\\text{cache_hit} = \\frac{5 + \\ln(\\text{storage})}{10}$$\n\nThe following plot illustrates the relationship:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyADaJINj.png)\n\n\nAnother important assumption is that the network on average achieves a cache-hit rate equivalent to providing storage of 4 TB (which is the default value for the slider). In other words, the speed performance obtained with a storage of 4 TB should result in the reward table of the V1 calculator since the node would performe as the network's average.", "metadata": {}}}
