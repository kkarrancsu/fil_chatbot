An example here would be a request that has an impossibly fast duration. At this level, we screen all the individual requests coming from the logs service and flag any that looks suspicious. The output is a list of flagged requests and the origin of their flags.\n2. **Operator level:** Level where we do not pinpoint a specific log that looks suspicious but, instead, we look at the general behavior of individual node operators. An example here would be an operator that is logging an impossibly high number of requests. At this level, we aggregated the raw logs for each operator and flag any that looks suspicious. The output is a list of flagged nodes and the origin of their flags.", "metadata": {}}}
