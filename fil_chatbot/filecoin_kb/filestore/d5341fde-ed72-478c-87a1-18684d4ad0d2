Concretely, higher usage means more transactions being executed and more service fees collected. More transactions mean more tokens being burned from protocol fees while more service fees mean more tokens being bought and locked into the Ecosystem Fund. Both these impacts lead to lower circulating supplies.\n- Staking sentiment also aligns with supply dynamics. When participants stake more (and unstake less), the total tokens locked within the Staking mechanism increases, which leads to lower a circulating supply.", "metadata": {}}}
