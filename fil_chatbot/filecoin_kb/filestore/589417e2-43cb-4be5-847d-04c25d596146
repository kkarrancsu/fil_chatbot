Similarly to the power model, scheduled releases may come from two types of sectors - known active sector and modeled sectors (i.e. newly onboarded and renewed):\n\n$$SR_t = knownSR_t + modelSR_t$$\n\nWe can take the scheduled releases coming from known active sectors  ($knownSR_t$) directly from the network. This is the $\\textrm{known_scheduled_pledge_release_vec}$ provided as input.  \n\nAs for the pledge releases coming from the modeled onboards and renewals, we can compute it using the previous locked pledge and the sector duration parameter ($d$):\n\n$$modelSR_t = Pl_{t-d}$$\n\nNote that if $t-d$ is lower than the current day of the forecast, then we define $modelReleasePl_t := 0$. In other words, if we are looking back to past data, then the known scheduled releases already contains the total pledge scheduled to be released. \n\n\n### Block reward collateral", "metadata": {}}}
