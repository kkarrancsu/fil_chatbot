If we want to ensure sufficient uptake of longer duration sectors, while not having a large endpoint multiplier, this may be a good option. Decreasing the slope from 2x to 1x lowers the incentive to store for longer. This decreases the potential to realize the positive effects to long-term stability and to client demand. This could be mitigated by making the slope gently increase with duration, which would encourage longer durations more.", "metadata": {}}}
