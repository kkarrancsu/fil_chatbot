Figures\n\n### Gradually Leaving\nEach of the figures below shows Network metrics for different scenarios of onboarding rates on the date when power starts leaving the network. In each figure, the dashed vertical line denotes the start of simulation, and the dotted vertical line denotes the date at which power starts leaving the network. A baseline case using a `DCAAgent` to simulate constant onboarding is also simulated to provide a basis of comparison (black dotted line). \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ-88veo3.png)\n*Fig 1: Filecoin Network KPI\u2019s in the optimistic onboarding case under several conditions of SP\u2019s leaving the network. *\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1RU8vxo2.png)\n*Fig 2: Filecoin Network KPI\u2019s in the status-quo onboarding case under several conditions of SPs leaving the network*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1IvIwein.png)\n*Fig 3: Filecoin Network KPI\u2019s in the pessimistic onboarding case under several conditions of SPs leaving the network*", "metadata": {}}}
