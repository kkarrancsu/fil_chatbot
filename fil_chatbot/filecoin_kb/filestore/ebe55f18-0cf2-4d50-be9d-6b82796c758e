In this setting, the change rate is more pronounced for smaller values of $a$ and more minor time scales. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hybqitkt3.png)\n\n\n\nJust as for circ. supply. we observe a rather mild dependency on the allocation parameter $b$, with larger $b$ leading to slightly larger inflations.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkzijYyK3.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, as in circulating supply,  increasing the max rate $r_\\max$ will increase the yearly inflation, however, this rate of change becomes less agressive as $r_\\max$ increases.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rk1r9OZYn.png)", "metadata": {}}}
