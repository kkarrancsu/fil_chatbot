From that plot, we can observe that the lower tail of the distribution of the base fee became shorter for the two weeks after the FEVM launch. This means the base fee for those two weeks was more concentrated around the 0.1-1 nano FIL/gas unit values. We can also observe, however, that for the last two weeks, such a lower tail has been expanding. Effectively, this means that during the previous two weeks, there was a significant portion of time where the base fee was lower, signaling a potential deceleration (or decline) from the spike. \n\nFurthermore, notice that the base fee in the weeks of 04/03 and 04/10 concentrated around smaller values than the week before the FEVM launch. In addition, there was a drop in the base fee on the day of FEVM, followed by an increase in this quantity. Such an increase could be due to, e.g., recoveries.", "metadata": {}}}
