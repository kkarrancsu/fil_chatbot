Because scores are multiplied, if one of the scores is very small, it will have a bigger impact on the total reward than what the linear combination would experience.\n\nIt is not clear the best approach here and this is yet another feature we will test with the simulation. However, unless there is a strong argument in favor of the direct multiplication approach, the **interpretability and flexibility of the linear combination approach make it the better option**.\n\n### Adjustment after penalties\n\nLet's start this subsection with an example. Suppose a new operator joins Saturn and begins to try to game the system by doing a huge number of fake requests to its own node. After the first two days, the fraud detection system flags this operator and applies a penalty. This means that the rewards that were originally assigned to this fraudulent node operator will not be paid.", "metadata": {}}}
