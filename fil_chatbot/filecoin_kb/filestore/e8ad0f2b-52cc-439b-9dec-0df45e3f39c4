In the case of minting and locking, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) projections of before and after baseline crossing are shown in Fig. 4, with the confidence bands shown corresponding to modeled uncertainty in onboarding and sector extension. \n\nInitially, following baseline crossing the minting rate decreases approximately 5x faster than if the network was at the maximum minting rate (no baseline crossing), but this immediately tapers to the more gradual decrease in minting rate shown in Fig. 4A. \n\nThe expected trend in locking as a proportion of circulating supply is shown in Fig. 4B. This trend is conditional on the underlying parameters for raw byte onboarding, FIL+ rate and renewal rate continuing on their current trajectories, which is an assumption, not guaranteed.", "metadata": {}}}
