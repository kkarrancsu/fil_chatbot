This is slightly larger than the amount of gas consumed by such a method in the past 180 days. However, it's still below historical maximums of about 9.5T daily gas units. Presumably, this is due to (1) network QAP growing (even if slowly) and (2) the current relatively high base fees.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkAegcoe2.png)\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/zVPtSJO.png)\n\n\n\n\n### User behavior", "metadata": {}}}
