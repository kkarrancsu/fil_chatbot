The subsequent lower minting rate, makes it more likely for this difference between the two lines to increase even more.\n\nThis mechanism leads to a worrying negative feedback loop:low baseline minting will lead to a lower minting rate, which again will lead to an even wider gap between the maximum possible baseline minting, and the realized baseline minting. \n\nThere is a risk that this dynamic would lead to a rapidly decreasing minting rate.\n\n### Proposal 2: Abruptly stopping baseline minting when we've had enough\n\n\nIf we do not want to alter the rate at which we mint tokens, the other alternative is to keep minting tokens at the same rate, but stopping the minting at some finite time.", "metadata": {}}}
