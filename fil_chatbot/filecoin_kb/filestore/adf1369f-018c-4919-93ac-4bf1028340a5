The minting rate curves follow these same trends.\n    - In the termination case, power continues to drop after the termination date. This is due to the logic of the implemented ROI agents, which dynamically onboards and renews power between the configured bounds as ROI is modulated. Consequently, the ROI estimation algorithm that the agents use significantly affects the output power trajectory.\n- Pledge\n    - In the termination case, the days immediately following the termination result in the ROI agent\u2019s FoFR estimate toggling above and below the configured minimum threshold. This causes a toggling of the pledge since the only remaining agents do not onboard power when the ROI estimate is below the threshold.", "metadata": {}}}
