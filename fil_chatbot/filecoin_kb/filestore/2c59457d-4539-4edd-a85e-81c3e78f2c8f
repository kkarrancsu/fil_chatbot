The network disburses maximum rewards when network RBP exceeds the baseline storage target, a key performance indicator (KPI). The baseline storage capacity is currently targeted to double network storage capacity annually, but this growth rate can be modified through approved [Filecoin Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs) (FIPs).", "metadata": {}}}
