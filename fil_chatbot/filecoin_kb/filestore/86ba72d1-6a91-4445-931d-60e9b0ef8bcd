In the inference-based approach these modeled as a Bayesian time series using a [Seasonal with Global trend model](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rlgt/vignettes/GT_models.html) trained on historical data to create forecasts of these inputs over the simulation window. Otherwise they are specified as counterfactural forecast test functions.\n\nIn either case the forecasts are inputs to the mechanistic model's power module, which are used to produce estimates of rawbyte and quality adjusted power. These are in turn used to generate trajectories of the minting rate and initial pledge and their evolutions which are coupled through the circulating supply components as specified in Filecoin's protocol. Finally derived quantities such as ROI as estimated.", "metadata": {}}}
