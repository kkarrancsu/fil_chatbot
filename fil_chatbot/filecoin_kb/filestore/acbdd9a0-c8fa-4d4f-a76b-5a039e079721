The percentage is a constant that should be viewed as a way to scale the borrowing costs with changing pledge requirements.  The 5% value can be changed, but the trends in the FoFR with costs row in Fig 2 would remain, regardless of the absolute value chosen.\n* A reference fixed cost per sector is selected. This is set to be equal to the borrowing cost at the beginning of the simulation. Fixed costs are then decayed over the course of the simulation to simulate hardware and sealing costs becoming cheaper over time. In the simulations above, we decay the fixed costs such that costs are halved every 3 years.  \n    * We note that this is likely a pessimistic fixed cost model because it does not take into account step-level changes such as Sealing-as-a-Service or the introduction of new technologies.", "metadata": {}}}
