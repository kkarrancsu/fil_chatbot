However the desire for implementing small changes must be balanced against the policy\u2019s sufficiency. In this, an important factor to recognize is that core economic changes cannot occur frequently. SP\u2019s should have a stable environment for business planning. \n\nIn summary, when combined with other changes (discussed next), we believe a 1x slope can be sufficient to achieve most of the proposal\u2019s goals. \n\nThe new proposed 1x sector duration multiplier looks like:", "metadata": {}}}
