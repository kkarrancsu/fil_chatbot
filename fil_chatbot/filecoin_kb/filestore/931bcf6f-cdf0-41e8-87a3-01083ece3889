This base fee payment does not go directly to the miner, but instead it is burned. As argued in [Roughgarden (2020)](https://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf), the miner utility is then,\n$$ u_m=\\sum_{j\\in B\\in M}(p_j-r-\\mu)\\cdot g_j$$\nwhie the user utility remains the same\n$$u_j=(v_j-p_j)\\cdot g_j$$", "metadata": {}}}
