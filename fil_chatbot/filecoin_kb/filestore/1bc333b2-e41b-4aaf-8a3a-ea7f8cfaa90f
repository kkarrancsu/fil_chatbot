Cianci & Maria Silva, CryptoEconLab, June 2023\n\n## Introduction\n\nOur `mechaQredo` package simulates the state of Qredo's economy given a set of (economic) parameters and market conditions (i.e., QRDO price, number of transactions in the network, etc). These input and output quantities are shown below. \n\n\n**Input quantities:** Tipping rate, protocol fee rate, validator reward share, staking rewards vesting decay, release rate $a$, proportion rate $b$ and max rate.  \n\n\n\n**Output quantities:** We will be focusing on monitoring *circulating supply, yearly inflation, validator rewards, Ecosystem fund balance, staking rewards, and APY*\n\n\nIn this study, we aim to examine the impact of input parameters on an output quantity. To achieve this, we will analyze two primary amounts for each combination of input-output:", "metadata": {}}}
