This is a signifcant change! However, this shock needs to occur in order to allocate the second billion tokens.\n- Notice that the uncertainty increases (i.e., the bands widen) as time evolves. This captures how changes in the long-term are more difficult to accurately predict that those in the short-term.\n- Token price has a balancing effect on circulating supply. Low token prices lead to lower circulating supply, which should provide a balancing effect on price. This is mostly caused by the service fees tipping mechanism - with lower token prices, the same USD amount of service fees results in more QRDO tokens being bought and locked into the Ecosystem Fund.", "metadata": {}}}
