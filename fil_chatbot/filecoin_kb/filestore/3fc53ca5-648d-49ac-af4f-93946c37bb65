This type of approach would remain aligned with a network that supports a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity's information. \n    * Increase the friction associated with misuse by making the distribution of datacap conditional upon retrieval tests.\n* Alternatives such as **removing Filecoin Plus are not likely to achieve the mission, since CC would then become the dominant strategy, not Regular Deals for storing data.**", "metadata": {}}}
