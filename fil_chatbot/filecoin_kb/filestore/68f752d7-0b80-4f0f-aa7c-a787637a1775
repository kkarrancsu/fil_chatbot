But, even though we want to give users the option to pay in fiat, we still need to transfer the value generated from these fees into Qredo's economy. Thus, given these limitations, we are left with the *discount model*, the *buy and distribute model* or the *buy and burn model*.\n\nThe *buy and burn model* is not the best fit for service fees. In the long term, as minting rewards decline, the value generated by service fees will be an important source of income for Validators and Developers.\n\nOn the other hand, users should have the option to pay in QRDO if they want. There is no reason to make fiat payment a requirement. Therefore, the **ideal model for Qredo service fees is a mix between the discount model and the buy and distribute model**.", "metadata": {}}}
