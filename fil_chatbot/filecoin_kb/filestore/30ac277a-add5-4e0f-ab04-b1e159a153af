This is most likely the effect of the decrease in the initial pledge required for the same sector caused by the decrease in circulating supply. This may be a **worrisome dynamic since SPs are incentivized to wait before sealing new sectors during the first months**. This is definately something we need to address.\n\nWhen compared with the baseline scenario, SPs only recover the same level of returns after more or less 2 years. We can argue that this will not be as big a problem as the waiting incentives issue. The lower FoFR should be compensated by the expected increase in the price of Filecoin caused by decreasing the circulating supply.", "metadata": {}}}
