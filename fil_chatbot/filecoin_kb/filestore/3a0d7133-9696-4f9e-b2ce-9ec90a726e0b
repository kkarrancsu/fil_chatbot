Two peaks in reward concentration occur because of the behavior of the ROI agents who remain on the network. After termination, these agents onboard and renew small amounts of power (due to their configuration), leading to power continuing to drop further until it hits its lowest point (where rewards concentration peaks). At that point, the ROI agents consistently pick up their onboarding and renewals.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJdKYDeo3.png)\n*Fig 7 - Comparison of Network KPI's for the gradually leave and suddenly leave scenarios.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkaQcEKdh.png)\n*Fig 8 - An illustration of agent decisions in the gradually leave and suddenly leave scenarios*", "metadata": {}}}
