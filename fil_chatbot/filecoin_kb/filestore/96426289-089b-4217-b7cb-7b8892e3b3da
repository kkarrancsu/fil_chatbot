These include overall network sentiment, which could influence SPs\u2019 decision-making beyond the rational approach outlined.\n- Recommended Action Items:\n    - Implement procedures allowing SPs to profit from the economically advantageous situation following a network shock before they are necessary. Examples include Network Shortfall to allow onboarding to grow faster than otherwise. \n    - Share this knowledge with SPs about the potential upside in a shock scenario to mitigate the impact of negative sentiment following a shock situation.\n    - Research updates to pledge functions that alleviate economic pressure on SPs while maintaining network security to reduce the likelihood of shock scenarios.", "metadata": {}}}
