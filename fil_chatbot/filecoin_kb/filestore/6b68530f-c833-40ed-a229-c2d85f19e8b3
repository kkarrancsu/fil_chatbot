Low token prices lead to lower circulating supply, which should provide a balancing effect on price. This is mostly due to the service fees tipping mechanism - with lower token prices, the same USD amount of service fees results in more QRDO tokens being bought and locked into the Ecosystem Fund.\n- Network usage is aligned with supply dynamics. Concretely, higher usage means more transactions being executed and more service fees collected. More transactions mean more tokens being burned from protocol fees while more service fees mean more tokens being bought and locked into the Ecosystem Fund. Both these impacts lead to lower circulating supplies.\n- Staking sentiment also aligns with supply dynamics. When participants stake more (and unstake less), the total tokens locked within the Staking mechanism increases, which leads to lower a circulating supply.", "metadata": {}}}
