Note that now we are plotting the FoFR for the 1-year sector with a FIL+ deal for all the simulation scenarios. Note that the *dur=1, slope=1* scenario corresponds to the baseline setting with varying targets.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/sH7BFZU.png)\n\n\nThe first observation is that, as expected, increasing the lock target, leads to an almost constant drop in return throughout time.", "metadata": {}}}
