The adjustable target block size is then split by an **allocation parameter,** $a\\in[0,1]$, such that storage related messages would have a target block size, $aB_T$, and FVM messages would have a target block size $(1-a)B_T$. The allocation parameter, $a$, could also be adjusted in a way that maximizes the given network target.\n\nThe general principle here is that if $D_{FVM}$ enters a harmful regime, where it is too large (in a positive or negative direction), the effects can be countered, and perhaps $D_{FVM}$ could be reduced by increasing the parameter, $a$, and allocating less amount of block space to FVM.\n\nA key aspect of this line of research is then understanding the effectivenes of the Block Balancer mechanism, over the default approach of doing nothing, in regulating the potential negative effects of net FVM gas demand.", "metadata": {}}}
