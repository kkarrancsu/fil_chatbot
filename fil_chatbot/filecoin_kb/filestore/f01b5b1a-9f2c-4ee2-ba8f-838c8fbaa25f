The mechanism renders old blocks unnecessary and enables the ICP to operate quickly by finalizing the transactions needed to update smart contract states.  These transactions are finalized within 1 to 2 seconds. Chain key technology is also responsible for the communication between the subnets, canisters, and the Network Nervous System (NNS)) and the network's consensus mechanism.\n\nChain key technology operates by splitting up the execution of smart contract functions into query calls and update calls \u2014\u00a0a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d approach that enhances the overall efficiency and speed of the ICP network.\n\n**Canisters**", "metadata": {}}}
