This means that they need to regularly submit messages to the network and pay gas for those messages that get included in the chain. \n\nThe amount of FIL that each miner is willing to pay per message depends on several factors; how urgent is it for them to send the message (due to recurring proofs of storage, for example), the type of message, their opex, etc. Thus, for each message class $i$ and each miner $m$, there's some associated *value* $v_i$. This value is, of course, imposible to know for each miner and for each message, as it is highly subjective. The goal of this section is to present a model and a framework that can overcome this.\n\nIn order to do so, we will make the following simplifying assumptions and observations.", "metadata": {}}}
