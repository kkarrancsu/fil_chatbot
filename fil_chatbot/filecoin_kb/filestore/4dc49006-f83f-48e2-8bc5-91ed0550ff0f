Registration requires a stake deposit with a lock-up period. Collateral can slashed; (2) **Random Beacon Layer.**  The overall purpose of the Random Beacon Layer is to provide the source of randomness for the consensus layer.  (3) **Blockchain Layer.**  This layer builds a blockchain from the verified transactions;  and, (4) **Notary Layer,** provides fast finality guarantees to clients in the network.\n\nDFINITY uses consensus to agree on the order of processing of the messages across all the nodes because the nodes aren\u2019t guaranteed to receive messages in the same order.  Messages are placed in blocks and then grouped together on the blockchain.  The messages are validated before they are transferred to the subnet.  \n\n**ChainKey Technology**", "metadata": {}}}
