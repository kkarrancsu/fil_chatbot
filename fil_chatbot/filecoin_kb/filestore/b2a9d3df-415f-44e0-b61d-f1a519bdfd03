Additional solutions described here include Plian (formerly PChain), Boba, StarkNet, and Dfinty.\n\n***Note:** Polygon [https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-edge](https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-edge) is a whole family of solutions including Miden (a STARK-based zk rollup), Edge (a framework for building private and public Etherium-compatible blockchain networks), Zero (a scalable Ethereum-compatible zk rollup), Nightfall (optimistic roll ups combined with zk rollups), Avail (a scalable data availability-focused blockchain for standalone chains and off-chain scaling solutions) and Hermez (an open source zk rollup for token transfers on Etherium).  Avail, Miden, and Zero are still under development.*\n\n## General\n\n### **Side chains vs Layer 2 Solutions**", "metadata": {}}}
