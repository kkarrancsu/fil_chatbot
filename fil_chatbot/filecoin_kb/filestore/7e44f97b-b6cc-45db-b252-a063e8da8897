A solution that has been proposed in Ethereum is [sharding](https://www.web3.university/article/ethereum-sharding-an-introduction-to-blockchain-sharding), where essentially the blockchain can be split into $N$ parallel blockchains, or shards (equally distributing the amount of validators and consensus power amongst the $N$ chains), while periodically reporting on their respective states to each other. (Note that the latest version of sharding planned for Ethereum differs from what we have described here, as they would initially include only [data-availability shards](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/sharding/) without excecution capabilities. )", "metadata": {}}}
