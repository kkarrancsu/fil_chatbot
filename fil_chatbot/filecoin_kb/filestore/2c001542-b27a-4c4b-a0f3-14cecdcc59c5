A) The Circulating Supply defined as _Minted + Vested - Locked - Burned_. B) The aggregate number Locked Filecoin from different pledges and rewards. C) The ratio of Locked to Circulating Supply. D) FIL minted per day, E) Network quality adjusted power (QAP) trajectories. F) Network Raw Byte Power (RBP) trajectories. G) Initial Pledge per 32 GiB sector onboarded. H) The 1 year ROI, before gas and capex/opex. The dotted line (15-Jan-2023) indicates when SDM is introduced. The average new duration is 3y, with 3x SDM. Other durations are shown in Appendix/Notebooks. In the New sectors CC-jump scenarios,  committed capacity (CC) power is terminated and re-onboarded on the same day the SDM is introduced. \n\n**Locked and circulating supply**\n\nThe \u2018new sectors\u2019 only scenario has the weakest effect in terms of locked and circulating supply, with slowest growth in QAP. This is shown by the green line in Figures 1A-F.", "metadata": {}}}
