Validators accumulate thousands of transactions together into a single block and submit a cryptographic commitment (the root hash) of the new state to the smart contract on mainnet.  The Validator also sends a cryptographic proof (a SNARK) confirming the new state is reflects correct transactions applied to the old state.  In addition to the proof, the state \u2206 (a small amount of data for every transaction) is published over the mainchain network as cheap (but limited) call data. This enables anyone to reconstruct the state at any moment.\n3. The proof and the state \u2206 are verified by the smart contract, thus verifying both the validity of all the transactions included in the block and the block data availability.\n\n**zkPorter**", "metadata": {}}}
