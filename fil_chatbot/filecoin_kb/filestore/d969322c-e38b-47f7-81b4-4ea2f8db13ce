Once mesages have been included in a block, we compute an *adjustment factor* for each lane, $A_{\\ell,t}$ defined as \n\\begin{align}\nA_{\\ell,t}:= \\pi_\\ell \\left(\\frac{G_{\\ell,t}-B_{\\text{target},\\ell}}{B_{\\text{target},\\ell}}\\right).\n\\end{align}\n \n\n2. Update widths according to \n\\begin{aligned}\nw_{\\ell,t+1}:=\\frac{w_{\\ell,t}(1+A_{\\ell,t})}{\\sum_{\\ell'=1}^L w_{\\ell',t}(1+A_{\\ell',t})}\\cdot B_\\text{max}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\nWhen congestion levels rise in a particular lane (i.e., the ratio $\\frac{G_{l,t}}{B_{\\text{target},\\ell}}$ is greater than 1), the adjustment factor $A_{l,t}$ becomes positive, leading to an increase in the width of that lane. This increased width allows more transactions to be included in that lane, effectively lowering the gas fee for that lane. As a result, storage providers in that lane would have a lower chance of being priced-out due to high gas fees.", "metadata": {}}}
