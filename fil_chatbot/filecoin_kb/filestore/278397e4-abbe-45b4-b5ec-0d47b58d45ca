The idea is to simulate a case where the network continues to operate as it is doing now. In particular, we assume an amount of new onboardings, FIL+ rates, and renewals equal to the current amounts observed. We also give some sensible estimates for the average sector durations.\n* **Fil+ all-in**: a scenario almost equal to the base scenario, but where we assume an increase of Fil+ deals up to a daily total of 5PiB. Note that currently, we are seeing almost 1PiB. The goal is to simulated a case where Fil+ really picks up and leads to more onboardings.\n* **Optimistic**: scenario that provides an optimist view of the base scenario. All the user-defined parameters increase when compared with the base scenario, and the Fil+ rate assumes the 5PiB of the Fil+ all-in scenario.", "metadata": {}}}
