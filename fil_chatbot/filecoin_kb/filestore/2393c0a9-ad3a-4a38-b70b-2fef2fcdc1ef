Note that the bandwidth smooth follows the same trend as the all linear, but since the speed and uptime metrics get a sublinear exponent, the \"penalty\" for poor performance is smoothed.\n\n:::warning\n:warning: An important caveat: the reward distribution obtained above depend heavily on the service metrics generated. If we were to observe a higher dispersion in performance, then the reward inequality would increase. In addition, as expected, this increase would be felt more heavily on the supra-linear functions.\n:::", "metadata": {}}}
