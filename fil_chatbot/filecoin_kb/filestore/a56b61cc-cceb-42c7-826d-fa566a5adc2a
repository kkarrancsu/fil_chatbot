In a way, L2s contribute to the performance of L1 nodes. The larger and more performant the swarm, the better L1 nodes will be at delivering content. As such, it makes sense for L1s to share some of the rewards they receive with the swarms. In particular, we can use the previous scoring functions to distribute rewards among L1 nodes. Then, based on how much each L2 contributed to the service the L1s provided, a part of the rewards distributed will be passed on to the swarms.", "metadata": {}}}
