Introduction \n\nThe Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) is quickly rising in popularity and it is posed to attract a larger and much welcome user base to the Filecoin network. However, one as-of-now hypothetical, but serious scenario that this larger user base might bring is what we call *gas gentrification.* In short, this refers to the phenomena where demand for FVM-related messages is so high that  either (i) it drives the base fee upwards to a point where it might become difficult for some miners to submit network-critical messages (such as onboarding, sector recovery of proofs of storage)  or (ii) that FVM users are simply willing to pay significantly higher tips to get their messages included, and thus pricing out some storage providers. Either case (which again, are purely hypotethical as of the time of writing) is a scenario that could potentially harm the network.", "metadata": {}}}
