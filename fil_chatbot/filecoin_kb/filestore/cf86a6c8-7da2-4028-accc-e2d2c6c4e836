Then, as we collect more data from Saturn and gain experience from real users, we will iterate and improve the detection model.\n\nNext, the reward calculator is the part responsible for processing transfer logs and other metrics, and computing how much FIL each node operator will receive. This is the part of the Treasury that will define the main incentives for node operators and guarantee that operators are aligned with the long-term vision and goals for Saturn.\n\nFinally, underlying all the components, we have the monitoring module. Because Saturn will function in an agile/iterative setting, we need to be able to monitor the entire payment process to improve both the log detection module and the reward calculator. We need to store the flagged entities and the payouts to operators.", "metadata": {}}}
