Because we need to keep track of sector longevity to model QA power, we have to split the scheduled expirations into 4 groups:\n\n* $SE^{RB}_0(t)$: RB power scheduled to expire at step $t$ coming from new onboards.\n* $SE^{RB}_1(t)$: RB power scheduled to expire at step $t$ coming from 1st-time renewals.\n* $SE^{RB}_2(t)$: RB power scheduled to expire at step $t$ coming from 2nd-time renewals.\n* $SE^{RB}_+(t)$: RB power scheduled to expire at step $t$ coming from sectors that have renewed 3 or more times already.\n\nAfter we model each component, we can set the total RB power scheduled to expire as:", "metadata": {}}}
