For Stakers, we focus on the APR and the weekly QRDO rewards received by a participant with the minimum stake amount. For Validators, we focus on the USD daily profit assuming a fixed OpEx of \\$200.\n\nLet's start with Stakers. In all scenarios, the weekly QRDO rewards obtained by the minimum Staker are higher than the protocol fee required to distribute the reward. In other words, all Stakers will receive enough rewards to cover the protocol fees to claim them.\n\nIn the combined scenarios, the average APR starts relatively high, ranging from 35% to 58%, depending on the scenario. Then, in the base and optimistic scenarios, as the TVL growths, the APR decreases steadily. After 3 years, the average APR is at 24% in the base scenario and 5% in the optimistic scenario. On the other hand, in the pessimistic scenario, the APR grows to 174% due to the low TVL of this scenario.", "metadata": {}}}
