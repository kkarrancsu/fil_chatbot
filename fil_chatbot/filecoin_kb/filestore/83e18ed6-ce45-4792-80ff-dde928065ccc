Fig. 1d shows the evolution of the Fil+ multiplier in this scenario.\n* NetworkQAP exhibits a declining trend across all onboarding scenarios, due to the reduced QA multiplier schedule, but QAP is higher than in the 1x scenario (**Option 1**). Compared to the cliff ramp-down schedule (**Option 2**), QAP has a smoother trajectory but still trends downward.\n* Network locked follows a similar trend, and this follows from the reduced collateral requirements from decreasing NetworkQAP. The change is smoother than **Option 2**, due to the smoothness of the Fil+ multiplier schedule.\n* The FoFR with costs gradually declines due to the linear rampdown of the Fil+ multiplier, but then increases. This follows from the reduced cost dilution each time the QA multiplier is reduced.", "metadata": {}}}
