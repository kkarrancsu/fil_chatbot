Additionally, the network's consensus mechanism, whether it's FPoS or DPoS, will also influence these costs. For example, DPoS requires validators to stake tokens. If validators choose to borrow the amount to be staked, this could be included in their OpEx due to the associated interest rate.", "metadata": {}}}
