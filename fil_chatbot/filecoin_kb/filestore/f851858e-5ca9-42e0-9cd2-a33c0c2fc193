In each figure, the dashed vertical line denotes the start of simulation, and the dotted vertical line denotes the date at which power starts leaving the network. A baseline case using a `DCAAgent` to simulate constant onboarding is also simulated to provide a basis of comparison (black dotted line). \n\nAn interesting feature to observe here is that reward concentration jumps immediately at the termination date. This is due to an sharp drop in QAP. It effectively stays elevated until the lowest QAP point, after it begins to decrease. Conversely, in the leave case (Fig 1,2,3), reward concentration builds as sectors expire from the network. After peaking, it subsequently decreases.", "metadata": {}}}
