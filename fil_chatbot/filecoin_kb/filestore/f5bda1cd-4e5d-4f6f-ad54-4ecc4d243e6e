In other words, a sector with more than five years will continue to receive the same duration multiplier as the 5-year sector. This limit may change in the tuning phase.\n\n## Model assumptions\n\nWhen designing this model, we focus on daily aggregate network dynamics. In order words,  we avoid complex simulations that capture individual miner behavior and, instead, model aggregate network metrics and mechanisms using sensible approximations.\n\nWith this in mind, the model has the following assumptions:", "metadata": {}}}
