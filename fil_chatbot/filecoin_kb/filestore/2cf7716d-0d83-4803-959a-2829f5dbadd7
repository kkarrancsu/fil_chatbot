This backs the principle that SPs who undertake a larger commitment should be rewarded commensurately. Detailed arguments on the shape of the multiplier function concern how much the network values long-term commitments in light of options to renew, potential cost to the network of expiration, and the locked collateral\u2019s equivalent risk free rate of return. These are set out in [1](https://hackmd.io/fDMYQ-4LQDiZ2KwKA7dn1w).\u00a0 As the theoretical forms partially depend on difficult to determine parameters, a linear multiplier function is selected. This is a compromise but does have the advantage of being a choice that minimizes complexity.", "metadata": {}}}
