The implications for Storage Providers as well as the broader token economy are discussed below.\n\n## 2. Inferred Baseline Crossing and Impact\n\nTo examine the timing and impact of baseline crossing, we first use an inference approach based on historical data. This provides an estimate of what we think is most likely to occur. However past trends may not continue into the future. To account for this we also consider a wide range of possible counterfactual scenarios in the following section.\n\n#### Timing of Baseline Crossing\n\nTo estimate the date of baseline crossing we explored two Monte Carlo-based methods to infer the date of crossing from empirical data. Technical details of each method are given in the Appendix and code for each is linked in the References. Both produce similar estimates of the baseline crossing date.", "metadata": {}}}
