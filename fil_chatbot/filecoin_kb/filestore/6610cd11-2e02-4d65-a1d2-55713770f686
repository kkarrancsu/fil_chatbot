This is another assumption we want to remove when we can extract the real data.\n* We are not changing the quality multiplier of currently active deals.\n* The quality multiplier for a known active sector will change after renewal based on the new sector duration multiplier and $\\textrm{fil_plus_rate}$. This means that when a known active sector renews, we assume that its percentage of Fil+ will also change to match the model assumptions.\n* The duration multiplier is given by a linear function of the sector's longevity. The slope of the linear function will be provided by the user.\n* Because we don't have data on the longevity of currently active sectors, we will assume all active sectors will be 1-year old at their termination date.", "metadata": {}}}
