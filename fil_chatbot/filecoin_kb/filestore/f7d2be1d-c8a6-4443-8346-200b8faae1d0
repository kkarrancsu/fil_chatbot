A range of possible optimistic and pessimistic scenarios are set out in the following section. \n\n## 4. Counterfactual Scenarios\nWe examined ten counterfactual scenarios that capture potential future SP behavior in the Filecoin network to gain further insight into the minting rate. Each scenario contains a different combination of exponential growth or decay of raw-byte power and renewal rate to a defined percentage of their historical maximum (ranging from 5% to 95%) 180 days after the simulation start. \n\nFig. 5A and B show the considered raw-byte onboarding power and renewal rates. Fig. 5C and D show the corresponding minting rate changes. As onboardings and renewals are scaled up, the date when total minting approaches simple minting extends to the future.", "metadata": {}}}
