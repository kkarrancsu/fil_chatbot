The changes proposed are in essence twofold: i) increasing possible sector durations from 180-540 days to 1-5 years, and ii) introducing a quality multiplier function that rewards longer-term sector commitments. To explore the effects on the economics of the Filecoin ecosystem and mitigate potential risks, CEL analyzed the proposed changes from the perspective of circulating supply dynamics and storage providers\u2019 return on investment.\n\n**Scenarios** \n\nScenarios are tested across linear duration multipliers with slopes of {0,1,2,3,4,5}, and new average sector durations of {1,2,3,4,5} years.", "metadata": {}}}
