Because machine learning is often probabilistic, verification can be difficult.  Any compute task will have a profile for its memory and CPU utilization that can be compared against the trace of the provider\u2019s run.  To enable this capability, a method for inspecting a running process (VM, container or WASM) is needed along with a way to determine if a provider\u2019s process matches the signature.  \n\nDetermining a fingerprint would be extremely hard to synthesize without actually running the process.  The initial execution trace Bacalhau will use CPU and memory usage over time, however many other trace variables can be used, such as the entropy profile of the output.  It may also be possible to monitor compute at the thread level; however, running a smaller number of threads may enable a malicious compute provider to generate fake threads.", "metadata": {}}}
