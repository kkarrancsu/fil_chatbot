In fact, the payout seems to be mostly flowing between the low performers and the high performers (which make only 20% of all operators). The exception is with $k_1 = 2$, where even the normal operator see their rewards reduce slightly to accommodate the higher rewards being given to the high-performers.\n\nIn the next plot, we show a scatter-plot of the total payout given to each operator against the total bandwidth served by that operator. Here, each dot is a single operator, and the data is split by scoring function and by operator type:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1O-rgjXo.png)", "metadata": {}}}
