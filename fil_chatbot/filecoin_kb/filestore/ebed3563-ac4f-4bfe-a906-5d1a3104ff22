The following plot shows the supply inflation rates expected from the current vesting schedules and the current token allocation (i.e. supply inflation $=$ tokens vesting at time $t$ divided by the circulating supply at time $t$).\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkhMlxBL2.png\">\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
