It is worth mentioning that, for the values observed, the assumption of stationary seems to hold, as shown in the figure below. Indeed, it is difficult to identify a trend in the time-series of $L(t)$ (figure on the left) for the dates considered, which suggest that the distribution $\\pi$ of these samples is stationary (i.e., does not change with time). The histogram and the KDE associated with the distribution $\\pi$ are shown in the right. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkUsXaQIi.png)\n\n\nOver a large number of runs of this simple Monte Carlo Simulation, we arrive at the following estimator for Baseline Crossing and relevant uncertainty: \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJOyk-bUi.png)", "metadata": {}}}
