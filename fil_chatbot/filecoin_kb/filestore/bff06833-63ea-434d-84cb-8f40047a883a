This rate would become the main way to encode how bullish new participants are. However, this assumption has a problem, as we know that tokens locked in a staking mechanism are not perfectly correlated with the circulating supply.\n- Similarly, one can assume that at each step, a given percentage $\\delta^\\text{new}$ of the circulating supply is staked. Contrary as the case above, however, in this setting we are assuming that $\\delta^\\text{new}$ is a random variable with some known distribution $M$, and that at each step, $\\delta^\\text{new}$ is independently sampled from $M$. This model relies upon a weaker assumption than the previous one, and has the advantage of capturing a wide array of behaviours, which can help us propagate and quantify this avenue of parameter uncertainty in the model.", "metadata": {}}}
