Here, each OpCode $c_{i_j}$ consumes a specific amount of gas $g_\\ell(c_{i_j})$ of a unique, specific, lane $\\ell$. Thus, any given message consumes $G^m_\\ell$ gas units, with $G^m_\\ell$ understood as the sum of the gas consumed by the OpCodes that execute on the lane $\\ell$. This is illustrated in the figure below. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJdhVJm9h.png)\n\nIn our design, a message can only be included in a block if **all** the OpCodes forming the message fit within their designated lanes (i.e., if there's enough gas available on each lane).", "metadata": {}}}
