Filecoin can also consider removing the minting cap on DataCap allocation. Although DataCap is not strictly a bottleneck to growth, it can become one if DataCap requests ramp up due to changing macroeconomic conditions. Relatedly, while DataCap allocation can become an issue, the network should devise new solutions to Fil+ abuse in a more scalable manner, to achieve the vision of Filecoin.\n\nAdditionally, the network should invest in new technologies that can reduce barriers to entry into the network. These can range from UX upgrades to more economic factors, such as innovations that reduce the capital needed to participate in the network.", "metadata": {}}}
