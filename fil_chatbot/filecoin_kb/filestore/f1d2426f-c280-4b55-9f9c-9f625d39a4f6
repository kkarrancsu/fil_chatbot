A percentage of service fees collected by Qredo is converted from USD to QRDO and locked in the Ecosystem fund. This increases tokens locked, reducing circulating supply and providing more tokens for Validators and Stakers.\n    - **Protocol fee model**. Transactions in the Qredo network incur a fixed fee that is burned, reducing circulating supply. This mechanism has a minor impact compared to others.\n    - **Release function for the Ecosystem fund**. The rate at which tokens are released from the fund to pay Validators and Stakers depends on TVL and the number of validators. This ensures more tokens can be released as the network grows.\n- Looking again at circulating supply and inflation, we see how these mechanisms work to soften the scenarios, creating a balancing effect on the economics of the network.", "metadata": {}}}
