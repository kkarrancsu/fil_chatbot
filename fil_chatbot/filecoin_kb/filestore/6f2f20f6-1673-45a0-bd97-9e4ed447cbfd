We use the value currently achieved by the network and take into account a level of variability around this central value.\n- The sector renewal rate is also constant on average over time. Similarly, we use the value currently achieved by the network with a level of variability around the central value.\n- We also consider that all new sectors being onboarded or renewed have the same duration. This is a fixed parameter that we vary between 1 and 5 years. Throughout the report, we refer to this parameter as the \u201caverage sector duration\u201d.\n- The percentage of newly onboarded power that contains FIL+ deals is another parameter we model. To simulate an increase in FIL+ deals, we assume that the rate of FIL+ deals increases linearly at a rate of 50% per year. The initial value at the start of the simulation is the currently observed rate.", "metadata": {}}}
