David announced a high-priority initiative to use data stored on the Filecoin network in a compute pipeline.  The project is known as Project Bacalhau.  [https://github.com/filecoin-project/bacalhau/](https://github.com/filecoin-project/bacalhau/). Bacalhau is the Portuguese word for cod.  Compute over data is often called CoD.  This initiative is an important part of the CryptoEconLab\u2019s 2022 plan.  \n\nThe initial target for Project Bacalhau is existing storage providers with data on nodes.   Existing storage providers will take the least amount of effort to ramp up.  The vision is for the storage provider to simply attach a Bacalhau wallet to their node and begin accepting compute contracts.", "metadata": {}}}
