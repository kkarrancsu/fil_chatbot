The better the scenario, the more tokens are staked, which increases the release rate of the Ecosystem Fund.\n- Independently of the scenario, validator rewards decrease with time. This occurs because the total available rewards do not grow proportionally to the number to number of validators (check Figure 1.3.1) and we are assuming a steady increase of validators during the first 2 years.\n- Token price has a significant impact on validator profit, which is expected since we are converting QRDO rewards into USD. Staking sentiment impacts validator profit in the same way as the impact seen in the average validator rewards.\n- Looking at the combined scenarios, at day zero, the validator's daily profit varies between \\$1.7k and \\$2.5k. After two years, the optimistic scenario leads to steady profits (1.9k at the end of 2 years), while the daily profits for the base and pessimistic scenarios decrease to $460 and -$56, respectively.", "metadata": {}}}
