The log detection module will be responsible for detecting the behaviors. After a specific log or node is flagged, there are different ways that we can penalize bad-behaving nodes:\n\n* Remove fraudulent logs, reducing the reward to the corresponding node\n* Apply a penalty to the total reward the node\n* Reduce the node's future rewards by limiting the requests it is able to serve\n\n## Log detection module\n\nThe log detection module aims to detect any doctored or fake logs submitted by node operators. Since the initial version of the Treasury service has to be designed before Saturn has real active users, we start with a simple heuristics-based detection system, tuned with sensible assumptions about how users will operate with Saturn and the testing data we already have.", "metadata": {}}}
