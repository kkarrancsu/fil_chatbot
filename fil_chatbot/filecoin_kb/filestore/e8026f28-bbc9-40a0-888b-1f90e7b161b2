In addition, if we consider that a single node may be able to impact performance in less popular countries (which would lead to a takeover cost of only 600 FIL), we conclude that **collateral is not a very strong protection against these attacks** while the network size remains small. This highlights the fact that we need early detection system in place since we cannot fully rely on economic arguments.\n\nIf the network triples in size, the takeover cost increases to 3000 FIL (or 15k USD). This is a more respectable costs, but still very low when we consider takeover costs of other decentralized network such as Ethereum or Filecoin.", "metadata": {}}}
