To model this, we scale the GLM model In Fig 6 by 85%. More precisely, if gas usage for PSD is reduced by 85%, then power will need to scale up by 85% to match the same gas usage as before.  The DDO model compared to the status quo is shown in Fig 7.\n\n![glm_case2_extrapolate](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ6N7qHIp.png)\n\n*Fig 7: Hypothetical model for forecasting the gas used when onboarding deal power with DDO implemented.*\n\nCurrent onboarding levels are roughly 4.76 PiB RBP/day at 92.6% FIL+ Rate, which translates to 44 PiB/day of deal power being onboarded. If DDO reduces gas usage by 85%, this increases the capacity of the chain to onboard upto ~293 PiB/day of deal power (under the linear scaling assumption).", "metadata": {}}}
