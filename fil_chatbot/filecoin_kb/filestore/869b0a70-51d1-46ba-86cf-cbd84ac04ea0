It is also acknowledged that in extreme scenarios, introducing a duration multiplier with the wrong parameters could lead to lower data onboarding and lower raw byte power (RBP), depending on what type of constraint dominates growth in the short term.\n- On the basis of considering more extreme scenarios, in the current iteration of the FIP-0056 draft we advocate for a precautionary approach. We suggest a maximum duration multipler of 2x at 5Y commitment, which corresponds to a SDM slope of 0.285.\n- Furthermore, we raise awareness that in order to protect rational incentives to maintain commitments across a wider range of scenarios, the community should consider revising termination fees upwards. The need for a policy upgrade is highlighted by and interacts with SDM, but also exists in a world without duration incentives.\n<!-- - We suggest a maximum multiplier of up to 2x at 5y.  -->", "metadata": {}}}
