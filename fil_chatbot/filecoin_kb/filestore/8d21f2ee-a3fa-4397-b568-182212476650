Indeed, we can see a spike in the inflation rate when this parameter is around 0.05. Once again, this goes in hand with the results obtained for circulating supply. \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk7nBGod2.png)\nA zoomed-in version is shown below.\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkKD9d-Kh.png)\n\nLastly, observing the tipping rate, there is a rather small effect of this quantity on the yearly inflation rate. Specifically,  increasing the tipping rate, in turn, slightly decreases the yearl\ny inflation rate. Furthermore, the effect of this decrease diminishes over time. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1rO5ObYh.png)\n\nFrom the above, we see that the most prominent input parameters, in this case, are the release, parameter, max, and tipping rates, as well the vesting decay rate for smaller values of such a parameter. \n\n### Validator rewards", "metadata": {}}}
