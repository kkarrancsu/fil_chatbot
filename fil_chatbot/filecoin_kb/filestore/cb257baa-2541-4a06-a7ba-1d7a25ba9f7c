Another option is to have a **hybrid pool that contains a pre-determined base component and a variable component**. The base component would be funded by a fixed initial pool of Filecoin while the variable component would be funded by the new clients joining the network. This way, the base pool gives more predictability, whiles the variable pool encourages growth and adoption. This is the chosen design for Saturn. We have an initial amount of FIL invested by Protocol Labs that aims to kick-start the network and provide that stable amount of rewards in the beginning. Then, clients come in, their FIL will be added to the pool, thus, continuing to fund the operation.", "metadata": {}}}
