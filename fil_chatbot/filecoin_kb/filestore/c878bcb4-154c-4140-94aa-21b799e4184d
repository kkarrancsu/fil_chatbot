But, for the purpose of this project, we will not explore it further as we expect that, in the short term, its impact on token supply and demand will be small when compared with other token features.\n\nThe next feature we considered is *payment*. Here, we have multiple fee models we could use. Particularly, Qredo will implement two types of fees:\n\n* Protocol fees - fees that need to be paid when submitting requests to the Qredo network. The goal is to avoid spamming attacks to the network and to support Validator operations.\n* Service fees - these are the fees already being paid by Qredo costumers in a pay-as-you-go model based the total volume transacted in billable operations. The question here is how to tie value of these service fees (which currenlty are mostly paid in fiat-denominated currencies) to the QRDO token.\n\nTheses questions and the proposed design for Qredo's fee models will be further explored in another [report](/v5r6y8a_TE6NtouVHmPnmA).", "metadata": {}}}
