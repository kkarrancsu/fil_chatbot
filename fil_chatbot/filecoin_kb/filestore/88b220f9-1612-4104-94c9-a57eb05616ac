At this point in time, user A deposits 1 ETH into the contract. Assuming overcollaterization of 0% for now, user A consequently receives 500 eFIL in return. \n    - At the contract level, some percentage (assume 70%) of the ETH deposited is converted to FIL and is put to work by SPs. By doing this, users get about 7% Annual Yield on the 500 eFIL that they hold (7% APY because, an SP gets 10% returns on all staked FIL, but only 70% is converted and put to work. The remaining stays in the contract as ETH for immediate wnrapping). Therefore, at day $t_0 + 1$, the balance of eFIL would become 535.\n    \n- At time $t_1$, assume that the price of ETH in terms of FIL goes up to 600.  With a overcollateralization rate of 0%, this means that the rightful amount of eFIL that user A should get for their deposit is 600 eFIL. The user can thus mint 100 more eFIL now.", "metadata": {}}}
