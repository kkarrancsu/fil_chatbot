Intuitively this makes sense since a larger $a$ will cause a smaller contribution from the ecosystem fund. Similarly, as before, the effects of $a$ in this decrease are more pronounced when $a$ is small; this is also due to the specific choice of (fractional) function for the release rate. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJwkaY1K2.png)\n\n\nAs we can see for the proportionality parameter $b$, we can see that, as this parameter increases, the rewards of the validators increase as well. Furthermore,  this increase is faily linear,  as it can be seen from the sensititivty plot (i.e., constant rate of change acroos $b$ for a fixed time.)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkbxTtyKh.png)", "metadata": {}}}
