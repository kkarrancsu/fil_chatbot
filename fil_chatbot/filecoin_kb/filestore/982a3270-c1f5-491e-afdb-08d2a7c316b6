Why do we need a time commitment? The reason is twofold:\n1. Having an upfront commitment of operators (and consequences in case the commitment is broken) leads to a more stable and predictable service.\n2. Having an \"end-date\" to the service allow us to reassess collateral calculations as the traffic and expected rewards change.\n\n:::warning\n:warning: Can we think of any issues/problems with asking operators to state a time commitment and slashing them if the commitment is not met?\n:::\n\nFinally, we note that the node operator only starts receiving requests once the funds are sent. This is to avoid fraudulent operators joining the network to disrupt operations without \"staking\" some money. If we allow operators to receive requests before the collateral is committed, then there is a clear opening for these type of behavior.\n\n### Slashing", "metadata": {}}}
