For a subnet to join as a direct child of the rootnet, it needs to pay a certain amount of collateral. This collateral is slashable (or a fraction of the collateral) if subnet commits any defined slashable offense.\n\nHere we propose a possible approach to pricing collateral.\n\n\n\n## Key elements of rootnet collateral", "metadata": {}}}
