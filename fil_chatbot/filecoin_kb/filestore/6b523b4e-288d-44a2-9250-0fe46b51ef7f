Property session reports are how long a node was on a given website and p2p transfer reports are how much data was sent from one node to another.\n2.

The bookkeeper is a python script that runs through all the logs in BigQuery and:\n   1. Does basic fraud detection. Irregular reports are dropped\n   2. After fraud detection, calculates earnings + charges and writes those calculation results to a separate BigQuery table\n   3. Issues payouts and charges customers based on the results of the above calculations.\n   4. The bookkeeper writes results to a table:\n      1. to leave a paper trail, and \n      2. so payouts and charges can be re-run in the future if things break or fail for any reason", "metadata": {}}}
