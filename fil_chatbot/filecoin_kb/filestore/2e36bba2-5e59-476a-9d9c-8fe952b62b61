The amount of network pledge shortfall increases as a higher amount of power with a larger shortfall adoption rate is onboarded relative to the total size of the network. The reason this design choice was chosen was because only sectors onboarded following the shortfall policy\u2019s implementation are able to take on any shortfall. Assuming any steady state rate of shortfall at the network level immediately upon a shortfall policy\u2019s implementation would therefore be an unrealistic approximation of network population dynamics.", "metadata": {}}}
