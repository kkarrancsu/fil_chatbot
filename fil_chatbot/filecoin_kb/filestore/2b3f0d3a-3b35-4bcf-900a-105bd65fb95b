However, while this cannot be accurately predicted, gas usage patterns can be studied. An example of this is shown below, where we investigated gas usage patterns in the Filecoin network  (relative to block space) . From there, we can already see that there are well-defined statistical properties for this usage. A full report with this information can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/BrlCWpykSTyQyQ3HNDFqUA).\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1J9llyhi.png)", "metadata": {}}}
