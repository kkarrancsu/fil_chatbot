Fig 9 shows this perspective and indicates that the additional investment needed for the pledge to increase onboarding is significant, even though the growth rate is sublinear. \n\n\n![onboarding_vs_investment_cumulative](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1ND7cSLp.png)\n\n*Fig 9: Total investment needed to onboard greater amounts of RBP than status quo.*\n\n## Conclusion\nThe cryptoeconomic impacts of DDO have been explored in this report. We find that it is unlikely to have a significant impact on supply. This is due primarily to the fact that gas_burn is a minor contributor to overall $\\mathtt{net_outflow}$. The reduced gas burn has two potentially negative consequences:\n\n* Reduced cost to spam the blockchain with irrelevant messages\n* Reducing the permanent outflow effect of burn", "metadata": {}}}
