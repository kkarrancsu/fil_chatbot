These parameters are forecast using traditional Bayesian time-series methods. In effect this is an assumption that the historical trend will continue \u2014 that the FIL+ Rate will continue to increase, Renewal Rate will remain around 60%, and Raw Byte Onboarding will oscillate around a low value of 2.5TiB/day.\n* **Assumption 5:** Supply simulations and derived quantities such as Initial Pledge and ROI are based on the median time-varying trajectories of the underlying parameters. \n* **Assumption 6:** Gas differs substantially across batching. Consequently ROI in Figure 1 is simply displayed pre-gas for the purposes of relative scenario comparison.\n* **Assumption 7:** Power is aggregated with daily granularity. \n* **Assumption 8:** Sector duration distributions are approximated with a single fixed duration in power and locking models.", "metadata": {}}}
