The Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) is not solely (or significantly) responsible for the base fee spike. Instead, other factors have played a role, such as favorable macroeconomic conditions, increased gas consumption,  and network growth. In addition, we also investigate a recent decrease in the number of blocks produced. All data is sourced via Sentinel.", "metadata": {}}}
