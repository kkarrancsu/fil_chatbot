Adding a collateral requirement can be effective at reducing node operator churn. However, its efficacy at preventing takeover attacks is small, which results in the need to have additional protection besides collateral. In addition, slashing collateral because of flags received from the log detection system requires better verifiability of the payout and log detection systems, which is an effort the team is still working on. \n\n## Motivation and principles\n\nSaturn is a decentralized network of nodes that work together to deliver online content fast. This means that anyone that meets the hardware requirements can join, contribute resources and collect payments from that contribution. This permissionless nature of the system means that the network is open to a set of attacks that need to be mitigated with the right incentive design.", "metadata": {}}}
