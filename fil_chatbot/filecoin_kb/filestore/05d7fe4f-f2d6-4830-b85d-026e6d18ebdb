On one hand, higher half-lives mean slower vesting, which reduces supply inflation. However, on the other hand,  higher half-lives lead to fewer tokens available for the Staking Model, which reduces the profitability of Validators and Stakers. Thus, there is a trade-off here.\n- Going from 6yrs half-life to 4yrs half-life leads to an increase in supply inflation of 1 percentual point (on average) while increasing APR by 3 p.p. and Validator profit by $150 (on average).\n- Going from 4yrs half-life to 2yrs half-life leads to an increase in supply inflation of 2 percentual points (on average) while increasing APR by 7p.p. and Validator profit by $367 (on average).\n\n\n**Plots:**", "metadata": {}}}
