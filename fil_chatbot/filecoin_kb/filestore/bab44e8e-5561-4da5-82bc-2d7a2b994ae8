Available models:\n    * Deterministic; compute changes in quantity, due to changes in demand (or `baseFee`), estimate sensitivities via derivaties. \n            * Derivative estimation, graphs, etc. \n    * Scenario-based: Assume base fee increases x%,how does this impact quantity Q?  \n    * Stochastic: Multiple possible models, all of them depending on a set of initial assumptions.
