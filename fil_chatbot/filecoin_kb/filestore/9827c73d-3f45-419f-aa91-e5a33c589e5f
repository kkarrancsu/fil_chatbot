This can also be extended to take other variables into account.  Furthermore, having obtained some historical data, one could try to forecast and simulate, using traditional methods from time-series analysis. \n\n**Target Function.** As mentioned earlier in this document, there are several possible definitions of target function.", "metadata": {}}}
