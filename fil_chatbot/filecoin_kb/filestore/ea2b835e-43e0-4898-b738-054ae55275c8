In general, these fees are meant to compensate network participants (e.g., miners, validators, etc.) for their participation on the network and prevent network spam and abuse by attaching a cost to transactions and smart contract execution. In general, gas fees (**in fiat**) are determined by three main factors:\n\n1. **Gas Used:** This is the amount of computational resources required to process a transaction or execute a smart contract. Gas is measured in *gas units*, and different operations have different gas requirements depending on their complexity. For instance, a simple ETH transfer might require 21,000 gas units. In contrast, more complex operations in smart contracts can require significantly more gas.", "metadata": {}}}
