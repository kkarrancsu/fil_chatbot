The roots of these two trees ensure no one can fake the data.  The roots are stored in a smart contract on Ethereum which provides a succinct representation of the state of the side chain. All other data is stored off-chain.\n\n***SNARKS and STARKS***\n\nThe main players in the ZK rollups (zkSync, Starkness, Polygon Hermez, and Polygon Miden [under development]) utilize different ZK algorithms.  zkSync and Hermez uses Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs) while StarkWare and Miden utilize STARKs.  STARKS add transparency validation occurs without the need for generated trust settings.  StarkNet and Miden preserve the security of L1 Ethereum by producing STARK proofs off-chain, and then verifying those proofs on-chain.  STARK validations are 10 times faster to generate than SNARK validations.", "metadata": {}}}
