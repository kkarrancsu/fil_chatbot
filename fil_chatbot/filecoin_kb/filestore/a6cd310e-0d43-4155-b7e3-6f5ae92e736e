The assumption to model the free market is that every agent will be acting in a way that generally maximizes their own utility. \n\nOnce we formulate the different utility functions and expected behaviors, a given level of net FVM gas demand can be used as an initial state for the system, after which different Filecoin agents will act in a way that maximizes their utility. We can then examine what is the final state, or final net FVM gas demand that these expected behaviors lead to. This can then be translated into the given target functions, where we could examine what was the effect of free market dynamics on the target we sought to maximize.", "metadata": {}}}
