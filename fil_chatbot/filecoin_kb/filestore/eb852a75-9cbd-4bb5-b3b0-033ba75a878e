There may be a need to temporarily store results during a midway point. Some legitimate compute processes can use considerable memory and disk space while other processes may be lightweight. In many cases, compute will be a one-time event while storage is The scheduler may need to make some estimate; alternatively, the client may be charged after the compute.  Some compute providers charge by the cycle.  The downside of that is that the client may experience sticker shock.", "metadata": {}}}
