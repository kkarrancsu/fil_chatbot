Indeed, while the effect in burnt tokens is small, immediate (i.e., one epoch), and relatively simpler to quantify, the long-term effects of increased demand for block space in quantities such as minting, locking, and unlocking are far more difficult to quantify. Recall from [the Filecoin specification](https://spec.filecoin.io/systems/filecoin_token/block_reward_minting/) that the amount of minted tokens at any given epoch depends, under certain conditions, on the Raw-Byte Power (RBP) of the network. Given this, one could then ask the question:", "metadata": {}}}
