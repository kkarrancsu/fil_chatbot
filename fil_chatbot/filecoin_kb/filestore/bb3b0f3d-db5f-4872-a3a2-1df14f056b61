Estimated incentives to terminate are conditional on model assumptions --- see notebooks in References. The models necessarily give a highly simplified perspective that does not account for the full complexity of implementing such a strategy. Nonetheless idealised rational incentives serve as a guide that any policy should aim to satisfy.\n\n\nFig. 3 and 4 below show the ROI ratios between terminating and selling hardware upon the introduction of an SDM at varying decision dates, and not terminating while maintaining hardware commitment and power prior to the SDMs introduction to the network, shown for the investment conservation and data onboarding conservation regimes, respectively.\n\n<!-- Note that this is shown for SDMs with slopes 1 and 0.285, in both the investment conservation and data onboarding conservation regimes.  -->", "metadata": {}}}
