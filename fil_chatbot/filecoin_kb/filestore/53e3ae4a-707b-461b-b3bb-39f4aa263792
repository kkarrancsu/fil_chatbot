This percentage may increase over time to around 50% if the FIP is implemented (based on simulations which are conditional on growth assumptions). This leaves around 50% still not locked up and therefore potentially available to borrow/lend. Unlocked FIL will be distributed among different stakeholders, such as retail investors, SPs, and lenders. If there is demand for borrowing, this will be satisfied by the free market, the efficiency of which is expected only to increase over time, especially as FVM comes online.\n\n### Should there be a ramp on InitialPledgeTargetLock?\n\nThe design space of various ramps has been considered.
