This assumption can be adapted in the termination incentives notebook.\n* **Assumption 3:** The gas cost to reseal a 32 GiB sector corresponds to values on [filscout](https://www.filscout.com/us) on the dates the analysis was done (28-Dec-2022 to 3-Jan-2023). This value, 0.0485 FIL/32 GiB sector, is likely a lower bound on gas usage in event of substantial termination-to-re-onboard. As with Assumption 2, this assumption therefore leads to the analysis overweighting the potential for termination-to-re-onboard occurring.\n\n**Supply model and derived quantities assumptions**", "metadata": {}}}
