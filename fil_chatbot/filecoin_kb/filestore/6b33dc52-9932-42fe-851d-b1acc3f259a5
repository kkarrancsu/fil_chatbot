All multiplier increases result in increased absolute Fiat ROI from the status quo. Closing the multiplier gap between FIL+ and CC/RD makes CC/RD more competitive.  The effect is more pronounced with the 5/5/10 option than the 2.5/2.5/10 option since the delta between CC and FIL+ is less in the former (2x vs 4x). The absolute value of the multipliers matters, which is why the FIL+ SP sees the biggest boost with the 5/5/20 proposal. \n\nThis effect additionally manifests in the relative ordering of the multiplier proposals. We observe that CC and RD benefit most from the 5/5/10 proposal, whereas FIL+ benefits most from the 5/5/20 proposal. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1mbzNe-p.png)\n\n*Fig 4: Fiat ROI projections for different multiplier schedules and RBP scaling factors, and Fil+ rate at a 20% reduction from the status-quo of 92%.*", "metadata": {}}}
