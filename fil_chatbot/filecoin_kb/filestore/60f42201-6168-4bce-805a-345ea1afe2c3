When the node misbehaves and is flagged by the [log detection system](/WihFXzN9QteSwIxHW5zKeQ).\n2. When the node breaks the agreed service upon onboarding (e.g., leaving the network earlier or consistently performing below the metrics stated).\n\nIn the first occasion, we apply the [penalty multiplier](/MqxcRhVdSi2txAKW7pCh5Q#Penalty-multiplier) designed previously. Recall that it is a multiplier of the average rewards of the operator. In the second occasion, we don't have a concrete proposal on the optimal amount, so some analysis and simulation is required.\n\n:::info\n:hammer: We still need to specify how much we should slash in case nodes underperform when compared with their commitment upon onboarding. And in which situations we say nodes are not delivering on their committed service.\n:::", "metadata": {}}}
