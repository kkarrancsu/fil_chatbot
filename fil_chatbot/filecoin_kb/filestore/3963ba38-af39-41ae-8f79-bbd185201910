We can see that while the Gini index for RBP has stayed mostly stable, such a value for QAP has been slowly decreasing, suggesting that newer miners are joining the network or that some of the smaller miners are onboarding more data. Notice that, in principle, it could also mean that larger SPs are quitting the network. However, this would contradict the fact that QAP has been growing almost steadily.  Alternatively, this decrease could also be casued by miners are splitting their operations into more miner ids, but also seems unlikely.", "metadata": {}}}
