Throughout the analysis we assume that we have 1000 L1 operators, and we generate their service metrics using specific statistical distributions. The plots below show the histograms for the three service metrics generated - total bandwidth, ratio of requests simultaneously above the speed thresholds (i.e. TTFB and download time), and uptime percentage.\n\n| ![](https://i.imgur.com/buTtSZ8.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/aDP8SXA.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/0nHGvle.png) |\n| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |\n\nUsing these randomly generated service metrics, we tested different scoring functions, namely:", "metadata": {}}}
