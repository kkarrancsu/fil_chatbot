The crux here is to model $\\mathsf{FVM \\ demand}$. We envision the following approaches:\n\n**Simplified approach (Apriori, lower effort, less explainability)**. A simple approach (that could also be considered as a first step), would be to consider a pre-defined model for demand of the form:\n\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathsf{FVM \\ demand}=a_t \\times \\mathsf{status\\ quo\\ demand}\n\\end{align}\n\nwith $a_t$ a scaling parameter (either positive or negative) ranging from -1 (so that when $a_t=1,$ $\\mathsf{total \\ demand}$ is 0) to some positive value $A$. The goal here would be to test different values of $a_t$; either as constants or as a function of time, $t$.", "metadata": {}}}
