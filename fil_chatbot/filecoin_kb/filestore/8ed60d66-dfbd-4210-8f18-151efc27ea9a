These mechanisms offer economic incentives for beneficial behavior and deter malicious actions, thereby aligning network security with the vested interests of token holders and promoting energy efficiency. This report provides a concise overview of these mechanisms and their tokenomics, introducing a general framework for designing such staking mechanisms.", "metadata": {}}}
