Draft phase: \n    - This phase will last 5 weeks \u2192 until the end of May\n    - During this phase, we will focus on designing and documenting the broad mechanics of the token. We will also propose some sensible values for the main tokenomics parameters. However, the final values will be defined with the caveat that they will likely be updated during the simulation phase.\n    - The main deliverable of this phase will be a **draft tokenomics report** that can be shared with the community. The report will contain the results of our initial analysis and a description of the current tokenomics design. We can also support the team with the draft of a simplified version of the report that may be simpler to understand by less technical audiences.\n    - This first draft will contain the following tokenomics components:\n        - Principles of the utility of the token\n        - Draft burn schedule *(concrete values may be subject to update)*", "metadata": {}}}
