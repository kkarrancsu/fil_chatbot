That is, if we want a finite continuous derivative then it should be true that\n$$c\\frac{B_t-B^T}{B^T}b_t\\to \\varepsilon$$\nfor large $\\varepsilon$.\n\nWe simply don't know if this condition is true, empirically, because we are not actually changing values of $\\varepsilon$ in real life to see what would happen. In fact in the current data it seems epoch-to epoch fluctuations are pretty significant, so not necessarily always true that $b_{t+\\varepsilon}\\approx b_t$.\n\n## Coarse grained limit\n\nInstead we need to consider a coarse grain limit, where *we dont vary the value of $\\varepsilon$, instead we only look at longer time scales, where epoch to epoch fluctuations are irrelevant.", "metadata": {}}}
