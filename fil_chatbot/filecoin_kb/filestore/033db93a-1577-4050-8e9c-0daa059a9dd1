Messages received by the P2P layer are replicated to all of the nodes in the subnet to ensure the security, reliability, and resiliency; (2) A\u00a0**consensus**\u00a0layer that selects and sequences messages received from users and from different subnets to create blockchain blocks that can be notarized and finalized by BFT Consensus forming the evolving blockchain. These finalized blocks are delivered to the message routing layer; (3) A\u00a0**message routing**\u00a0layer that routes user- and system-generated messages between subnets, manages the input and output queues for dapps, and schedules messages for execution; and, (4) an\u00a0**execution environment**\u00a0that calculates the deterministic computation involved in executing a smart contract that process the messages it receives from the message routing layer.", "metadata": {}}}
