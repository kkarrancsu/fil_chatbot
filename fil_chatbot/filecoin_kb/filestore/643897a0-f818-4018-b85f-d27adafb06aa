This increase could be due to various reasons. One of them is that it is often the case that the base fee increases after a network upgrade due to, e.g., recoveries, etc.   In any case this warrants monitoring.\n- We note that the standard deviation of the base fee has slightly increased after FEVM. Since base fees can rapidly vary among scales, this more significant standard deviation is a byproduct of having a base fee oscillating around larger values.\n- It is worth noting that the data used to compute the pre-FEVM statistics includes periods of very low network usage, which will naturally skew the mean towards smaller values. Indeed, there have been periods pre-FEVM where the base fee has been comparable (or larger) than what it currently is.", "metadata": {}}}
