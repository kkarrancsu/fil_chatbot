This offering is enabled by Qredo's integration with [MetaMask Institutional (MMI)](https://metamask.io/institutions/), making Qredo the only MPC-based custodian offering this integration. \n\n*QL2 transactions* are token swaps within Qredo's Layer 2 network. Users can deposit any of the [supported cryptoassets](https://qredo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407177502097-Supported-Assets) and trade them with other Qredo users, facilitating cross-chain transactions between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.", "metadata": {}}}
