Direct Data Onboarding is a FIP that introduces technical upgrades which enable a cheaper pathway to onboard deal power onto the Filecoin network. Many expenses are associated with onboarding FIL+ data, but DDO addresses gas-related expenses.\n\n### Gas & Base-Fee Background\n\nGas is a measure of the computational resources that a message will impose on the blockchain.  Therefore, different messages require different amounts of gas. The Gas Fee (or transaction fee) used to charge for those computational resources contains two components, the amount of Gas used to submit a message (in units of Gas) and the $\\mathtt{basefee}$ (fee per unit of gas). Since transactions are settled in units of FIL, the cost of submitting a particular message at epoch=t is given by:\n\n$$ \\mathtt{cost} = (\\mathtt{basefee_t} + \\mathtt{minertip}) * \\mathtt{gasrequired_t} $$", "metadata": {}}}
