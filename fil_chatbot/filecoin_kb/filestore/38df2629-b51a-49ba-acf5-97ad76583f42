Tipped service fee and released rewards for Stakers and Validators are the components that most impact the net flows in the Ecosystem Fund.\n- Now, if we focus on each individual parameter:\n    - The tipping rate does not significantly affect Staker and Validator profitability but impacts the long-term balance of the Ecosystem Fund. Increasing the tipping rate by 10 percentage points locks an additional 10 million tokens in the Ecosystem Fund, reducing supply inflation by 1 percentage point.\n    - The validator reward share mainly affects Staker and Validator profitability, with higher shares benefiting Validators at the expense of Stakers.\n    - The vesting decay rate influences supply inflation rates and profitability, with shorter half-lives leading to higher inflation and increased profitability.", "metadata": {}}}
