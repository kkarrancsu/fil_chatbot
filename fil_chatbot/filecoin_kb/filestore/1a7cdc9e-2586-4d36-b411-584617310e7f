It may make sense to launch a token in future version; however, the least amount of friction will result from using Filecoin.\n2. **Choice of Smart Contract.**  Turing-complete smart contracts allow for flexibility but introduce some security risks; however, non-Turing-complete smart contracts are not likely to enable the type of compute required.  \n3. **Validation Layer.**  The TrueBit approach may be a useful model for validation.  It is possible to contract directly with TrueBit to use the model (as Golem has done) or to create a similar approach.  If Bacalhau\u2019s Trace Validation approach can be developed quickly, it may be able to run in parallel or in place of the game-based verification model.", "metadata": {}}}
