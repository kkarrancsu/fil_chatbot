From the perspective of stability, the principle of minimum multiplier change that incentivizes longer sector durations should be adopted.\n\nIn the *outermost* scenario tested \u2014 where new sectors have an average duration of 5 years and the linear multiplier has a 5x slope \u2014 the locked FIL at +3 years is estimate to be 3.5x higher, and the circulating supply is 30% lower than a no-change reference (ie in the case this FIP is rejected).\n\nHowever, a new average sector of 4 years with a multiplier slope of 3x may be a more likely outcome of potential changes under discussion. This is treated as the central scenario which is given more attention next.\n\n**Central scenario**", "metadata": {}}}
