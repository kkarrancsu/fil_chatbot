We should also note that the Ecosystem fund will have an accelerated vesting when the new tokenomics are introduced. The goal is to have the Ecosystem fund fully available on day zero.\n\nIn summary, we will have the following source of changes in circulating supply:\n\n**Supply Inflows:** *(i.e. increases in circulating supply)*\n\n- Vesting:\n    - Linear vesting from the previous allocations to the team, advisors, investors, seed rounds, and the treasury.\n    - Exponential decay vesting from the Staking Program Support fund.\n- Locking releases:\n    - Stakers participating in the Federated Proof-of-Stake consensus model (Staking Model). When they unstake their tokens, they stop participating and receiving rewards.\n    - Service fees distribution from the Ecosystem Fund\n\n**Supply Outflows:** *(i.e. decreases in circulating supply)*", "metadata": {}}}
