By understanding the composition of block as a function of demand can help us understand how will FVM affect the demand for block space. Furthermore, by examining the utility functions of different stakeholders in the Filecoin network, we can gain a deeper understanding of their interactions and their effects on network performance. This knowledge is crucial for designing and operating a decentralized storage network like Filecoin.\n\nThis first report is intended to (1) formulate the system at hand and (2) provide a qualitative and \"first order\" understanding of the effects of the (upcoming increase in) demand in the FIlecoin network.", "metadata": {}}}
