Compatibility\n\n**Backwards compatibility** This change requires a hard fork since the base fee is enforced (for blocks to be considerd valid).  Tools that provide gas estimates will need to be recalibrated to account for the new mechanism.\n\n**Future-proofness** As technical innovations that change the costs associated with M&O messages are introduced, the formula used to compute the target block sizes will need to be revaluated.\n\n\n**Relation to FIP064** FIP064 proposes to implement an EIP1559-type of Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM) where the update is taken based on a weighted average of the gas usage over a number of epochs, rather than on the gas usage on the previous epoch. If such a FIP were to pass, then its proposed a TFM would need to be implemented in multiple lanes.
