When compared to FIL+ SPs, RD SPs have lower pledge borrowing costs, and potentially lower business development and bandwidth costs. However, they also receive a smaller share of the block rewards.\n4. **V1-ExploitFIL+** - This models an SP actively exploiting the FIL+ program and not growing a storage business. Compared to the FIL+ SP, the V1-ExploitFIL+ SP does not incur business development costs, does not store an extra copy of the data, has reduced bandwidth costs, and are not subject to any penalties for exploiting FIL+.\n5. **V2-ExploitFIL+** - This is similar to the V1-ExploitFIL+, except that this SP tries to project an image of being faithful to the FIL+ program. As such, this SP incurs the cost of storing an extra copy of data and has increased bandwidth costs in order to pass any sort of retrieval test that may be conducted.", "metadata": {}}}
