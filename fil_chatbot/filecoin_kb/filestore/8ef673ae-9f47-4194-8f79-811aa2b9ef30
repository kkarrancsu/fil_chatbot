It can be interpreted as the probability of an honest node being flagged.\n- $\\tau$, the ratio of rewards that honest nodes should receive on average.\n- $P$, the penalty in case of detection.\n- $n$, the number of past payouts at payout time $t$.\n\nThen, the upper bound assumption requires that the expected reward of honest node be above $\\tau$ times the rewards before penalties, which leads to the following inequality:", "metadata": {}}}
