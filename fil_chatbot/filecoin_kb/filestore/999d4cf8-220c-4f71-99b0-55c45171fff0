We already introduced the notion of the 4 different renewals groups based on longevity. For each group, the equation is very similar - we just need to multiply the scheduled power to expire coming from the correct sector group by the renewal rate $r$. Recall that the renewal rate is user-defined parameter and is a constant ($r := \\textrm{renewal_rate}$). The equations are the following:\n\n\n* $R^{RB}_1(t) = r \\cdot (knownSE^{RB}(t) + SE^{RB}_0(t))$\n* $R^{RB}_2(t) = r \\cdot SE^{RB}_1(t)$\n* $R^{RB}_3(t) = r \\cdot SE^{RB}_2(t)$\n* $R^{RB}_+(t) = r \\cdot SE^{RB}_+(t)$", "metadata": {}}}
