In addition, the worse the detection system (i.e. the lower the true positive rate and the higher the false positive rate), the smaller this window is. In fact, these curves already give us some goals that we should meet with the detection system, namely, having a false positive rate lower than 5% and a true positive rate higher than 25%.", "metadata": {}}}
