As such, the following two statements may be at odds.\n        - Any one can spawn a subnet (unlimited network TPS) and hence further crushing network protocol revenue through BaseFee mechanism (unlimited chain bandwidth supply).\n        - Bringing value to the parent chain as there is value created with horizontal scaling.\n        - Balancing the two goals will be the key tradeoff for the policy that governs spawning of new subnet.", "metadata": {}}}
