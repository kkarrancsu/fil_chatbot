A rational miner would realize that they can increase their utility by introducing an artificial **effective block size**, $B^*$, a finite amount of gas that they will admit into the block. We denote $B_M$ as the total amount of gas of every transaction in the Mempool.\n\nTo understand how an effective block size would affect the total network revenue, we invoke the user's value distribution as defined above. Using the value distribution we could find out what would be the gas cost $p^*$ users would have to pay to include their message on chain, if the miners have imposed an effective block size, $B^*$. The gas cost is given by the relation,\n$$1-\\frac{B^*}{B_M}=F(p^*)$$, or\n$$p^*=F^{(-1)}\\left(1-\\frac{B^*}{B_M}\\right)$$\nwhere $F^{(-1)}$ is the inverse of the cumulative value distribution.", "metadata": {}}}
