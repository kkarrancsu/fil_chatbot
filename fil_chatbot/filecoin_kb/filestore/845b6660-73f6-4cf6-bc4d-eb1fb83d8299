An quantity that is sometimes evaluated by investors is the **fully diluted value**, or $FDV_t$, as a hypothetical future market cap the project will have *if token price remains the same*. This is calculated as,\n$$FDV_t=P_t*S_{\\rm max}.$$\nThis quantity provides investors with some idea of what the future valuation for a project may look like, but it relies on the **strict assumption that token price would not be affected by increasing the supply**.\n\n\nIn this analysis, we are more interested in isolating what would be the inflationary effects of the maximum token supply. Instead of holding token price as a constant as is done when calculating $FDV$, we consider the alternative that *Market cap is not affected by increasing circulating supply*, and therefore explore, what happens to token price, if market cap remains constant.", "metadata": {}}}
