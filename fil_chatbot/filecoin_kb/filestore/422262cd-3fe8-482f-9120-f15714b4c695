This data was obtained on an epoch-to-epoch basis. We then proceeded to compute the average gas usage in each network over a given period (5 minutes). Then we compared the amount of gas used on each network. More formally, let $G^e_t$ and $G^f_t$ denote the total amount of gas used at epoch $t$ by the Ethereum and Filecoin network, and let $\\tilde{G}^e_t$ and $\\tilde{G}^f_t$ denote the 5-minute average gas usage of $G^e_t$ and $G^f_t$. Our analysis consists of estimating the 5-minutes ratio of averages defined below. $$\\mathsf{ratio}_t:=\\frac{\\tilde{G}^f_t}{\\tilde{G}^e_t}$$\nNotice that the procedure above results in a time series for $\\mathsf{ratio}_t$ form, which we can obtain several statistics: \n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1FswHxmh.png)", "metadata": {}}}
