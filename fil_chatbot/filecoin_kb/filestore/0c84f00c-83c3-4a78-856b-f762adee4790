When a request is submitted to an L1 node, there are two possibilities - either the L1 node has the content cached or it does not. If the content is cached, then the swarm has no contribution to the service. However, if the content is not cached, the L1 node will request the data to its swarm. The L2 nodes that have that content in cache will start sending it to the L1 node and, as such, a part of the rewards obtained from that request should be shared with the L2 operators that sent the content.", "metadata": {}}}
