Since DDO frees block space, we identify three relevant cases:\n    * Case 1 - There is no increase in onboarding or chain activity to fill emptied block space.\n    * Case 2 - There is an increase in onboarding, but not enough to fill block space to the target of 5B gas units.\n    * Case 3 - There is an increase in onboarding and chain activity to fill block space to the target.\n* **Findings**:\n    * Gas burn from $\\mathtt{basefee}$ is a small percentage of the $\\mathtt{net_outflow}$ of circulating supply. This implies that DDO has a small impact on overall circulating supply (CS) and Locked/CS.", "metadata": {}}}
