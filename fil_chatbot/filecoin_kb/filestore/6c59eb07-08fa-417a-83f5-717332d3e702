Particularly, Qredo will implement two types of fees:\n\n- **Protocol fees** - fees that need to be paid when submitting requests to the Qredo network. The goal is to avoid spamming attacks on the network and to support Validator operations.\n- **Service fees** - fees computed in a pay-as-you-go model based on the total volume transacted in billable operations. The goal is to have a fairer distribution of network costs by requiring clients moving a higher volumes through Qredo to pay more.\n\nFor each type of fee, in the following sections, we will aim to answer the following two questions:\n1. How are fees collected?\n2. How are fees computed?", "metadata": {}}}
