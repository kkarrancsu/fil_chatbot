As we previously discussed, Qredo charges service fees to its clients for using its custody products. Service fees can be paid in either QRDO, USDC, or USDT. The network incentivizes the use of the QRDO token by providing a 15% discount on these service fees if paid with the QRDO token. However, there are still a big majority of fees being denominated in USD.\n- **Synthetic staking**. Qredo offers a weekly staking event with a 5.05% APY reward for holding QRDO tokens within the Qredo Network. This *synthetic staking* (i.e., no need to lock tokens into a pool) is automatic and rewards are distributed every Monday. \n\nOne of the key outcomes of the tokenomics update currently underway is to increase QRDO utility and align it more closely with the value being produced by the Qredo economy. In the next subsection, we will discuss the new token features being introduced to QRDO.\n\n### QRDO token features", "metadata": {}}}
