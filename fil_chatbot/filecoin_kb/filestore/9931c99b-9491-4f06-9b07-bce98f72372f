This is because the wave of terminations drops QAP and increases supply. In turn, Initial Pledge spikes, and upon re-onboarding locked supply increases substantially. Such an extreme scenario as this is considered unlikely as a rational choice due to the disincentive the spike in Initial Pledge creates for re-onboarding. On the other hand, the \u2018new sectors\u2019 scenario does create more uncertainty for the network, since if termination did occur it opens the possibility of terminated sectors not returning to the network.  \n\n**Initial Pledges and FIL-denominated ROI**\n\nAcross all scenarios Initial Pledges decrease in the medium-term following the introduction of SDM, see Figure 1G.", "metadata": {}}}
