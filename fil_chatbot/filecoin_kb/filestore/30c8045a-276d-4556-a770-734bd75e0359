Not all messages have the same type of demand (elastic vs inelastic). Can we settle on a classification of messages? An example of this could be:\n\n    * i. Proofs of space-time (`submitWindowPoSt`) --very inelastic demand\n    * ii. Onboarding/PoRep proofs (`PreCommitSector` and `ProveCommitSector`) \n    * iii. F(E)VM messages -- more elastic demand\n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJ_04HtLo.png)\n\n**Base fee.**\n\nOther than gas consumption $G_t$,  perhaps the most obvious place where this new type of message will affect is the base fee  (`baseFee`).  Recall that for an epoch $t$, the base fee $b_t$ is adjusted dynamically at the next epoch, according to the following formula:", "metadata": {}}}
