The change in RBP is maginified for deal power due to the 10x QA multiplier\n2. As onboarding is scaled up, circulating supply decreases while network locked increases.  These are compounding effects that result in a large change to the L/CS trajectory.\n\nIn the FIL conserved regime, the small increase in onboarding that results from decreased gas costs does not result in any meaningful changes to the supply statistics (blue line) from the status-quo. This makes sense because gas costs are a small percentage of the total cost for onboarding sectors.\n\n\n## Case 3 - Increased onboarding and chain activity for gas to reach target block space.\n\nWe now analyze Case 3 - the scenario where block space is filled to the capacity through increased onboarding and other chain activities.", "metadata": {}}}
