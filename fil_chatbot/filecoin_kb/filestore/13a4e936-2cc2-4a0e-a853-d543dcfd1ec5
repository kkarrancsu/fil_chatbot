The pledge size is meant to adequately incentivize the fulfillment of a sector\u02bcs promised lifetime and provide sufficient consensus security.\n2. **Block reward collateral** corresponds to the number of future block rewards that get locked at the time each block is mined. Block rewards earned by a sector are subject to slashing if a sector is terminated before its expiration. The goal here is to avoid having an initial pledge too high for SPs while still maintaining good storage security.\n3. **Storage deal collateral** is an additional pledge provided by the SP to collateralize deals. This is an agreement between the storage user and the SP and it is not imposed by the protocol. In line with our assumptions, this will be assumed to be zero.", "metadata": {}}}
