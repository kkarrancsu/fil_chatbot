This is because the sudden drop in power results in a large increase in the circulating supply rather than a gradual increase, as in the leave case. Even though the baseline crossing of QAP occurs, its effect is not as significant because less time has elapsed, resulting in the CS contributing a more extensive effect to increasing pledge.\n- Reward Concentration\n    - In both the leave and terminate cases, reward concentration hits its highest point when network QAP is at its lowest point. \n    - However, in the terminate case, reward concentration jumps immediately at the termination date due to an initial sharp drop in QAP. It effectively stays elevated until the lowest QAP point, after it begins to decrease. Conversely, in the leave case, reward concentration builds as sectors expire from the network. After peaking, it subsequently decreases.", "metadata": {}}}
