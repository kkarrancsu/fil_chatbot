The project is currently ongoing and is a major bet for 2022.\n\nAccording to [Saturn\u2019s roadmap](http://strn.network/#roadmap), the project will go over different states of maturity. In Q2 2022, we hope to launch a **private network with a few L1 nodes** in order to test the L1-IPFS interactions and see if Saturn can perform better than simply using the IPFS gateway. It is important to note that this first network will be composed of trusted workers and thus we don\u2019t expect it to include any undesirable behavior from the side of retrieval providers (which are called node operators).", "metadata": {}}}
