The report suggests that this is not solely due to the Filecoin-Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) introduction but also due to other factors, such as network growth. \n- *FIL Spent:* There is an increased volatility in FIL spent during 2023 starting from around mid-February, stemming from the pattern seen in base fees. Despite the increased volatility, the average spending has remained comparable to other periods of high network activity.\n- *Gas Usage*: Overall, we found a slight decreasing trend in the amount of gas used by the `PreCommitSector,` `ProveCommitSector,` and `SubmitWindowedPost` methods. However, there has been a significant increase in the gas used by `PublishStorageDeals` since December 2022, likely due to the implementation of FIP0045.", "metadata": {}}}
