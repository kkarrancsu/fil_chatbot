To do this, we will first estimate the minimum amount that an SP needs to spend in a day (to provide storage and avoid getting penalized), then divide this number by 2880; the number of epochs in a day. \n\nLet $\\Pi$ and $\\Pi_j:=\\rho_j\\Pi$ denote the total power of the network (in bytes) and the power of SP $j$ (also in bytes), respectively.
