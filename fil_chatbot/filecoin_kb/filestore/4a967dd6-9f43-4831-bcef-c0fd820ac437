The second assumes the current price of FIL (i.e. 5 USD)\n\n\n## Saturn's intrinsic value for bandwidth\n\nBefore explaining how the calculator is defined, we need to recall how the reward pool for the first launch will work. This is important because it allows us to estimate how the network values each new TB of bandwidth entering the network (what we called the network's intrinsic value for bandwidth).\n\nIn this case, we use a *growth reward pool* mechanism, which aims to distribute rewards based on the network\u2019s growth. The idea is to have a baseline of network growth at each point in time (i.e., the total bandwidth delivered) and to increase the available pool of rewards as the network achieves the defined baseline. More details on this mechanism can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/@cryptoecon/SJIJEUJbs/%2FMqxcRhVdSi2txAKW7pCh5Q#Full-simulation-setting-the-final-parameters).", "metadata": {}}}
