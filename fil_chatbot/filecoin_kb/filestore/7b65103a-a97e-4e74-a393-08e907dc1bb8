We can also see that the histograms for the interarrival times are well-approximated by an exponential distribution. In particular, for the high-usage case, we can see that such a distribution is characterized by a parameter $\\lambda_H\\approx0.04$, which means that, on average, there is a high-demand peak every $\\lambda_H^{-1}\\approx 20$ blocks. Similarly, one can conclude that, on average, there is a low-demand valley every $\\lambda_L^{-1}\\approx20$ blocks. Lastly, it can be seen from the ACF plot of both functions that the ACF goes to zero almost immediately, which suggests that these interarrival times might be statistically independent of each other. This is a rather interesting fact since the exponential distribution and the statistical", "metadata": {}}}
