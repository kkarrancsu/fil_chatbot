This is a more radical change that sees:\n* QAP drop significantly compared to no change.\n* Locked collateral is much lower than no change. This is an issue because out of the two main contributions to network security \u2014 hardware and consensus pledge collateral \u2014 the collateral component is estimated to be an order of magnitude greater by fiat value. So if locked collateral decreases this makes it easier to take control of the network.\n* In the immediate term of 1-3 years, FIL-on-FIL returns (FoFR) with costs included drops from around 25% to -25%. The drop is because new power cannot benefit from the cost dilution offered by the Fil+ multiplier, whereas existing power can.\n    * Note that the exact values will depend on factors such as the FIL exchange rate, individual SP cost models, as well as future network power trajectory.", "metadata": {}}}
