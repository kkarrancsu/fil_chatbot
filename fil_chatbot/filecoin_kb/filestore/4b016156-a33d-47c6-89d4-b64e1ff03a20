To achieve the network\u2019s goals more adeptly requires a better mechanism. An alternative approach could be to set the goal the network has for the ratio of capacity vs deals front and center. For example, target a 25% CC to 75% deal ratio. From this it is easy to work backwards using a simple control mechanism to set a dynamic multiplier to ensure the network hits such an agreed upon target. \n\nThe call to action for the community is to build on this, and think of different and better ways to incentivize data storage that are less blunt than a fixed 10x multiplier.\n\n## Would data storage have grown without Filecoin Plus\nAlthough history\u2019s thread is singular, we can establish some points of reference and test our intuition on what would have happened had the Filecoin Plus program not existed by considering counterfactual scenarios from different perspectives.", "metadata": {}}}
