On average, this utilizes about 30% of the gas for any given block. Similarly, as with the `ProveCommitSector` message, this message was included in all examined blocks, and the distribution for the gas it consumes is also left-skewed. As it can be seen from the ACF plot in the bottom right, the ACF decays to zero at around lag 10. This can be roughly interpreted as it taking 10 blocks for any two values of gas usage by this method to become statistically independent. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FaU2NSL.png)", "metadata": {}}}
