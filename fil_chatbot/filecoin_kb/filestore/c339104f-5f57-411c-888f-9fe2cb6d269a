Notice then that the amount of tokens locked for staking is strictly positive for stakers, and we allow it to be zero for validators, to account for the FPoS case.  Similarly, we denote the minimum holding time for both validators and Stakers by $\\tau_v^\\min>0,\\bar{\\tau}_i^\\min> 0$, respectively. Lastly, we define functions $u_v(S_v,t)>0,\\bar{u}_i(\\bar{S}_i,t)> 0$ which control the unlocking of the staked tokens. In particular, for a given amount of locked tokens $S$, $u(S,t)$ releases these $S$ tokens over time. This can be done by e.g., releasing all tokens all at once after some given time, by continuosly releasing some small amount over time, or by releasing the staked amount in *chunks*.\n\n\n\n\n### Parameter overview\n\nThe table below summarises the different choices of parameters, their implications, and a recommended value.", "metadata": {}}}
