Unstructured input parameters of FIL+ rate of newly onboarded power, renewal rate, and raw byte onboarding are forecast using a Bayesian time series model. \n\nIn the \u2018All sectors CC-jump\u2019 and \u2018New sectors CC-jump\u2019 models, eligible CC power immediately extends or terminates then extends the next day respectively. Eligible means CC power within a 1 year window following the SDM introduction date. \n\nThe jump scenarios are extreme limits: extension occurs on the same date the SDM is introduced. Termination occurs the same day, and re-onboards gradually over the next 60 days. Such sharp changes are implausible but useful in their simplicity to provide bounds. \n\nFor more details see referenced notebooks.\n\n\n## References", "metadata": {}}}
