This can be computed as\n$$P^W_t=\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\int_0^T \\frac{C_t(1-\\mu)^{t^\\prime}}{S_{t+t^\\prime}}dt^\\prime,$$\nwith,\n$$\\tau=\\int_0^T(1-\\mu)^{t^\\prime}dt^\\prime$$\n\nWe present a simple example of an exponentially increasing circulating supply \n\n\n### Example: Exponentially increasing supply", "metadata": {}}}
