For instance, Hosanagar et al. [1] did an empirical analysis of how to price the service provided by centralized CDNs. On the other hand, Khan Pathan et al. [2] proposes a system (and the corresponding economic model) to assist CDNs to connect and share resources, while Garmehi et al. [3] describe a scheme that incorporates peer-to-peer resources from the network's edge to a classical CDN. Both rely on an auction model and profit maximization for pricing.", "metadata": {}}}
