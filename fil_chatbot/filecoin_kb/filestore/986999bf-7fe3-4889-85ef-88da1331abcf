Fig 4 shows this projection. Here, we assume that deal income for FIL+ SPs is $16/TiB/Yr and compute the Fiat ROI at an exchange rate of $4. To simulate a potential increase in the exchange rate as a result of increased locking, we do the following:\nCompute a ratio of of the network locked between the multiplier scenario considered and the status-quo.\nDefine an additional hyperparameter, sensitivity, to be a user-definable parameter that represents how sensitive the FIL token price is to the associated increase in locking.", "metadata": {}}}
