Stated differently, lower SDM values produce higher ROI but lower network locking, while higher SDM values produce lower ROI but higher network locking. Effectively, the choice of SDM slope enables a fine-tuning of the balance between immediate rewards and network stability and security.", "metadata": {}}}
