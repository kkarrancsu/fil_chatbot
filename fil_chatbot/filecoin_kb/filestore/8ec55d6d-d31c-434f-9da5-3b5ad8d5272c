To simplify the derivation, let's set $K_1 := \\frac{\\mathcal{M}_0 \\cdot P_0^{RB}}{m \\cdot s}$ and $K_2 := m \\cdot s \\cdot \\sum_{t = 1}^{d_e} \\frac{R_t }{\\mathcal{M}_t \\cdot P_t^{RB}} - G_{\\Sigma}$. with this assumption, the formula for FoFR get's simplified to:\n\n$$FoFR = K_1 \\cdot \\frac{K_2}{20 \\cdot R_0 + q \\cdot C_0}$$\n\n\nNow, the percentage difference in FoFR experienced by changing the lock target from 0.3 to $q^*$ is the following:", "metadata": {}}}
