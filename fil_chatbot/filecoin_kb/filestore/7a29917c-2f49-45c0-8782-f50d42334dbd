We then find the optimal block size, such that the corresponding total network revenue (base fee* reduced target block size) is maximized. This optimal block size is labeled in the above figures as B* . We find that in many cases, network revenue could be maximized by reducing the size of the block.\n\n\n\n## Utility Functions", "metadata": {}}}
