We discuss the details of this change in the last section.\n\n## Growth Reward Pool\n\nThe *growth reward pool* aims to distribute rewards based on the network's growth. The idea is to have a baseline of network growth at each point in time (in this case, the total bandwidth delivered) and to increase the available pool of rewards as the network achieves the defined baseline.\n\nMore concretely, given the following variables:\n\n* $B_t$: the actual cumulative bandwidth provided by the network from launch to the payout time $t$\n* $\\tilde{B}_t$: the cumulative bandwidth baseline set as the goal for the network to deliver between launch and the payout time $t$\n* $R$: total reward pool in FIL\n* $n$: total number of payouts for the reward pool $R$", "metadata": {}}}
