This fixed token amount would become the main way to encode how bullish new participants are. This assumption is better since it breaks the perfect correlation with the circulating supply. However, we do know that this fixed influx of locked tokens is also not realistic as circulating supply does have some impact on token availability for prospective Stakers. \n- Similarly, one can assume that at each step, a given amount of tokens will be staked. Contrary as the case above, however, in this setting we are assuming that this amount is a random variable with some known distribution $M$, and that at each step, the amount is independently sampled from $M$.", "metadata": {}}}
