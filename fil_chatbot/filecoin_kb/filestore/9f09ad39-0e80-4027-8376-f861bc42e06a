The first one being incentives to rollup operators, and the second one being incentives to drand node operators. In both cases, the value flows to the user. \n\n### Rollup Mechanisms \nIn order to design the mechanisms of the rollup, we need to further break down the economic flows into costs and revenues. We consider the entire rollup to be a system, and assess the costs as outflows and revenues as inflows in a framework similar to [the one introduced by Barnabe Monnot](https://barnabe.substack.com/p/understanding-rollup-economics-from). What we are breaking down below is the entire left fork from the previous diagram on the economic flow model. \n\nRollup systems have a complex cost structure, which can be divided into three categories:", "metadata": {}}}
