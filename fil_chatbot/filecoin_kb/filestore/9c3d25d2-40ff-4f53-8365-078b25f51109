One can only say that Saturn delivers a *fast* service when a significant portion of node operators are *fast*. With this in mind, we are not interested in incentivizing single nodes to decrease their download times indefinitely, but instead we want the entire network to be better than a certain threshold of each download time metric.\n\nOne way to encode this incentive is to use the percentage of requests of a given node operator with both TTFB and total download time lower than some predefined thresholds. With this new metric, we can use the exact same functions defined for bandwidth. At the same time, we avoid rewarding node operators on achieving great speeds on a few requests and, instead, reward by how many of their requests are better than the thresholds.", "metadata": {}}}
