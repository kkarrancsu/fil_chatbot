In the base scenario, the network only goes below the baseline after September 2024. Even in the pessimistic scenario, the network only crosses the baseline during July 2023. In other words, the rapid growth Filecoin experienced in 2021 made a nice cushion, which gives us some time to address a baseline crossing event. \n\n\n## Base scenario\n\nNetwork parameters have values equal to the ones observed at the end of May:\n* $\\textrm{renewal_rate}$: 50%\n* $\\textrm{rb_onboard_power}$: 27 PiB\n* $\\textrm{fil_plus_rate}$: 2.9% (800 TiB / $\\textrm{rb_onboard_power}$ in TiB)\n* $\\textrm{duration}$: 1 year (360 days)\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJNzpNgEo.png)\n\nIn this scenario, the baseline crossing event occurs in 2024-09-06.\n\n## Fil+ all-in scenario", "metadata": {}}}
