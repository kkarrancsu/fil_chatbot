Block rewards and data deals also provide them positive utility, but are left out of this analysis, since they don't change under first price auction or EIP 1559 mechanisms. \n\nIn contrast to [Roughgarden (2020)](https://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf), we will assume there are no *fake* transactions that are submitted by the miner. It was shown under both first price auction and EIP 1559, these transactions would provide negative utility to the miner, so we will assume miners will not include them.\n\n**First price auction utility function for myopic miners:** Let $M$ represent the mempool of all transactions that want to be included in the current block. Let $B\\in M$ represent the subset of real transactions that are actually included in the current block.", "metadata": {}}}
