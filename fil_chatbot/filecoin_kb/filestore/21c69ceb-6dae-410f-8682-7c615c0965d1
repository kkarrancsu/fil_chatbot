As shown [here](https://hackmd.io/vmi9ROQeTqefuVDDvy1jYg?both) it can be shown that, under a specific choice of *adjustment parameter*, this mechanism behaves *exactly* as a mechanism with multiple base fees, however, they are not, in general the same. We believe that using multiple base fees is more direct and easier to understand. \n\n###  3.3 Lane adjustment mechanism \n\n\nAlternatively, one can devise a mechanism where block space is allocated to each lane in proportion to its gas usage, thereby ensuring an equitable distribution of space and preventing the monopolization of resources by any single lane.", "metadata": {}}}
