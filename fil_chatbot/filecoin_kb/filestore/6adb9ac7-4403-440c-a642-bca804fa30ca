This would include messages such as `SubmitWindowdPost`, as well as  the recovery messages.\n- Data onboarding lane: 50% of the block, with a target of 25% of the maximum block size. This lane would include messages such as `PreCommitSector`, `ProveCommitSector`, `PreCommitBatch` and `ProveCommitAggregate`.\n- 'Others' lane: 30% of the max. block size, with a target of 15%. This lane would include all other types of messages, including all FVM-related messages.\n\n---\n**Remark.** *It might not always be straightforward to identify the difference among these messages (e.g., an FVM contract that takes care of SP maintenance messages); and as such one needs to be careful with the classification.*", "metadata": {}}}
