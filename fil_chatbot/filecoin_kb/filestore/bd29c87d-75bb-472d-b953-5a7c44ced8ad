Note that the impact of price on APR is insignificant because we considering QRDO-denominated returns!\n- Staking sentiment has a visible impact on Staker's profitability. In general, higher TVL (total value locked) leads to lower APR and weekly rewards, which creates an incentive early joiners. This occurs because the total available rewards do not vary proportionally to TVL. Recall that the Staking Program Support Fund provides a steady source of rewards that are independent of network performance as it follows a simple exponential decay. Thus, as more tokens are staked, even though more rewards are unlocked, the increase in rewards is smaller than the increase in TVL - which leads to lower APR and lower weekly rewards for a minimum Staker. We can see this effect in Figure 1.3.1.", "metadata": {}}}
