So the sealing dynamics can equivalently be cast in the form of survival model with surivival distribution $S$, or directly in terms of the pdf for the sealing duration $g$. This may seem like a minor point, but it's useful for understanding, and gives us some implementation flexibility. \n\n## Simple practical approximations\n\nThe pdf of sealing lifetime including renewals $g_{t,\\tau}$ can worked out from empirical data, but as it's a 2d --- the duration distribution is also changing with time --- it's worth trying to simplify our calculations. We can do this by writing in terms of a stationary effective duration distribution $\\tilde{g}_{\\tau}$, times the extension rate $e_{t}$ on that day:", "metadata": {}}}
