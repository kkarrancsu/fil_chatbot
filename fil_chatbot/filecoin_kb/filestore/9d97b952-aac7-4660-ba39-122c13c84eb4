The model receives two types of inputs, the tokenomic parameters and the \"market\" inputs that encode user behavior, adoption, and the current status of the network.\n\nGiven a **fixed** set of inputs, MechaQredo always outputs the same estimates. In other words, MechaQredo does not introduce any source of randomness or uncertainty, leaving us with the flexibility to encode it in the \"market\" inputs.\n\nMechaQredo implements a simplified version of the new Qredo economy assuming the proposed Fee Models, the Staking Model, and the new token allocations are introduced at the same time. Concretely, it estimates the daily trajectories of the four components that contribute to the circulating supply of QRDO (tokens vested, burned, locked, and released) and the daily profitability of the Staking Model (for both Validators and Stakers))", "metadata": {}}}
