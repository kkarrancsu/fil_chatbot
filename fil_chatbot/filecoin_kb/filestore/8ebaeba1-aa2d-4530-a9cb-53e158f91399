The results are illustrated in the figure below. The x-axis represents the day where the sector was sealed, i.e., we are computing the FoFR for a sector starting in each simulation day. The reason why the 3-year sectors don't have a FoFR after the middle of 2024 is due to the simulation length. We had to guarantee the existence of simulated data for the entire lifetime of the sector.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/U3QFO8G.png)", "metadata": {}}}
