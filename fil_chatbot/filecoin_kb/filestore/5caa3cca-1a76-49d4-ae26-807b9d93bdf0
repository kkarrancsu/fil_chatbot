Both systems encompass the production and exchange of goods and services facilitated by their native currencies (the native token). Both highly depend on \"foreign trading\" and can suffer currency risks. Both rely on humans to optimally organize the economy's limited resources to produce goods and services that can be traded with the outside.\n\nIn this context, blockchain networks implement algorithmic protocols that enable their workers (the \"miners\") to organize resources and participate in the production of a specific good/service. These protocols include rules for token issuance and allocation to network participants and regulations for token outflow (i.e., when tokens are removed from circulation permanently or temporarily). This management of circulating supply dynamics is a crucial aspect of blockchain economies, similar to how island economies manage their resources.", "metadata": {}}}
