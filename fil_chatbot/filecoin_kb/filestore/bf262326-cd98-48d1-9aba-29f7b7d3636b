Simplicity over complexity \u2192 we only add complexity if it serves a purpose and, thus, we try to build the simplest process that achieves the goal.\n2. Bounded rewards \u2192 since we are still in a testing phase, we should limit the daily rewards to avoid overspending in case of DDoS attacks and other anomalous behavior.\n3. Incent a reliable and performant service \u2192 these are the two main attributes we care about when designing incentives. First, we want operators to serve a high volume of retrievals with a fast download time. Retrieval volume is measured by the total bytes served in a given time interval, while the download time is measured as the time-to-first-byte (TTFB) and total download time. Second, we want operators to be reliable and fail gracefully (this is more important for L1s than L2s).\n4. Incent honesty \u2192 Operators should be incentivized to report their own faults and be truthful about their own logs", "metadata": {}}}
