The primary difference between these two approaches is that optimistic rollups depend on fraud proofs during a period of time called a  \u201cchallenge window\u201d while zk Rollups depend on validation proofs and are immediate.  Validation proofs are cryptographic proofs while fraud proofs are submitted by human watchers who stake a claim on the fraud proof and risk losing their stake if the fraud proof doesn\u2019t hold up.  During the challenge window (usually about seven days) of optimistic rollups, transactions sit in a pending state; offending transactions can be corrected in the event a fraud proof occurs. If the challenge window expires without a fraud proof, the main chain is updated.  Validation proofs for ZK rollups run on every batch of L2 transactions but optimistic rollup fraud proofs run only if a transaction or chain state is disputed during the challenge window.  Optimistic rollups provide near-instant transactions and they do", "metadata": {}}}
