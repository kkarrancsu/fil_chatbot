Consider a block of maximum block size $B$ and $L\\geq 1$ different *gas lanes.* In our setting, we embrace the concept of \"one message, multiple lanes,\" where every message *taps* into gas from several lanes based on its components. Here, each of these lanes is equipped with its own EIP1559-like transaction fee mechanism, with a specific target gas usage on each lane. This target gas usage then gets adjusted on an epoch-to-epoch basis according to the relative requirements for each lane.", "metadata": {}}}
