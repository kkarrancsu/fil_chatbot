The column title indicates the scenario being investigated. The blue, orange, and green lines correspond to 5, 10, and 15 PiB/day raw-byte power onboarding at the policy update date.  The brightness of the line corresponds to the increase in onboarding before policy update, with brighter lines corresponding to larger increases. The cost model for the \u2018FoFR with Costs\u2019 rows is described in the appendix. In the FoFR with Costs panels, before the policy change, the lines correspond to the typical 10x miner, and after the event they correspond to the specific scenario.*\n\n## References\n* [Simulations](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab/blob/mechafil-jax-notebooks/notebooks/mechafil_jax/filp_experiments/filp_scenarios.ipynb)", "metadata": {}}}
