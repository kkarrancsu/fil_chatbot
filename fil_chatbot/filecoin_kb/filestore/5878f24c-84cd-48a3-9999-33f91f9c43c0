Lower bound assumption - the penalty should be large enough so that it is not economically advantageous to cheat. In other words, the expected reward of cheating (taking into account the probability of detection) needs to be negative.\n2.

In other words, the expected reward obtained by an honest node should be higher than a certain percentage of the total rewards.\n\n#### Deriving lower bound\n\nGiven the following variables:\n\n- $R_t$, the reward a cheating node receives at payout time $t$, before any penalty is applied.\n- $\\alpha$, the true positive rate of the log detection system (we are assuming this rate is stable through time).
