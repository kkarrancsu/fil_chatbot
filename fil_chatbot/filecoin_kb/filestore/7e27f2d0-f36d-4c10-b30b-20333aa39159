As we can see from the figure below, as $\\alpha$ increases, the proportion of the messages occupied by FVM messages increases; however, this proportion rapidly decreases as $p$ increases. On average, regardless of the initial value, once the base fee is roughly above $10^{-10}$ tokens per gas unit, the block is dominated by SP maintenance messages.\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJWYLB61h.png)\n\n\n\n\n**With preference -- prioritizing SPs**", "metadata": {}}}
