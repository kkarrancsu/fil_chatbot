Instead, Saturn takes the log of the retrieval directly from the node operator that served the request.\n\nSince node operators are paid for the retrievals they provide, there is a clear attack vector where operators may change these logs to exploit the network and collect a bigger share of the rewards being distributed.", "metadata": {}}}
