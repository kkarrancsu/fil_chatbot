Furthermore, given that such an increase in base fee has been decreasing, or at least stabilizing in the last couple of weeks, **it would not be accurate to claim that such a spike in base fee is due to FEVM.**.  \n\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bys8hhEGh.png)\n\n\n\n### FEVM-Related Gas Usage and Correlation with Base Fee\nWe now examine the amount of gas used by FEVM-related messages Vs. Base fee, on an epoch-to-epoch basis. For clarity, we say that a message is a *FEVM-related message* if its `family` is either one of {`eam`, `evm`, `ethaccount`, `placeholder`} *or* if its sent from or received by an `F4` address. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1lsc7NMn.png)", "metadata": {}}}
