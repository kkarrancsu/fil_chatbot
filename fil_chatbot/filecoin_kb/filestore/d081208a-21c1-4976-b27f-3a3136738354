Discussions began happening initially between single individuals, and within multiple small groups independently. This gradually filtered up to a wider agreement a problem existed that should be prioritized. This was raised as a FIP discussion around 1.5 months ago, a short time after preliminary investigations.\n- Multiple research groups have dedicated effort to the proposal because it\u2019s considered important. This has allowed it to progress quickly.\n- Other projects may move slower. This is not necessarily a good thing.\n- Because the effects of the changes are coupled it\u2019s necessary to consider and implement them together.\n\n### *There is not enough FIL circulating to fulfill the changes this FIP potentially entails.*\n\nIt is understandable how this view can arise by multiplying the current locked collateral by the max 5x, but this isn\u2019t the right way to think about it.", "metadata": {}}}
