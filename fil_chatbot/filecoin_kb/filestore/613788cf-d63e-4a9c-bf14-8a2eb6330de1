QAP has been growing since mid-February 2023 at roughly 0.016 EiB per day. Notice that this steady increase in QAP coincides with the period of (a) token growth and (b) base fee spike. **Given that onboarding makes up about 25-30% of the gas usage, this is likely a more substantial contributor to the increase in base fee than, say, FEVM messages.**\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJM2leSz3.png)", "metadata": {}}}
