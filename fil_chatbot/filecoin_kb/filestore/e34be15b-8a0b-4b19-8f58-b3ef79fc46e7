If the majority is compromised, they can irreversibly steal all of the assets. And since most bridges operate in a **delegated PoS** model with low-latency consensus requirement, the majority of the stake is usually controlled by only a handful of validator servers physically located in the same data center. \n\n## Permissionless Protocol Experimentation\n\nAlthough not widely discussed, the ability to create side chains allows developers to experiment with protocol changes without permissions; thereby, spawning innovation on the base chain.  New features can be tested on side chains and moved onto the main chain only when proven to work in practice.\n\n## Fragmentation and chain interoperability", "metadata": {}}}
