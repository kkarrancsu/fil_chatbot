They bring capital and spend it in the economy by buying the services offered by Qredo. Some clients may also be internal to the economy, meaning they are Validatiors or Stakers spending tokens they received from minting. Clients are another key group influencing token flows as they are the driver of adoption and a powerful influence to token demand.\n* **Developers** are the \"civil servants\" and \"builders\" of the economy. They are responsible for maintaining the core systems and implementing new features to improve the services provided by the economy. For this, they are also compensated. As with Validators, this compensation may be a mixture of newly minted tokens (QRDO) and a cut of fees collected by the network. As Qredo is in active development, Developers are still an important group to maintain and engage.", "metadata": {}}}
