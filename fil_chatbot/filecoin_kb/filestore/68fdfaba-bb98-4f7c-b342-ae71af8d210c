Schematic illustrating how waves of expiration and renewal could become synchronised through coordinated early extension. The extent to which this could occur is reduced by several factors.\n\n\n\nAnother important consideration around shocks is the termination fee. Enabling a power multiplier has the potential in the medium term to lead to less stability through lesser relative cost of intentional termination. On this point the current termination fee was set early in the design of the network in the context of 6 month sectors. Its reassessment is overdue, and is part of a broader theme of the cryptoeconomic network parameters needing to change as the network evolves to ensure alignment with network goals. Aligning termination fee incentives should be expected to land in a subsequent proposal if the SDM policy is adopted. \n\n**Accessibility**", "metadata": {}}}
