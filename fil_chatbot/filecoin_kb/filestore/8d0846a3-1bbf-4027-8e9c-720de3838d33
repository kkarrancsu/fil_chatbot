Furthermore, notice that this quantity can be upper bounded by $Z_t:= 2632.09\\times \\mathsf{Network\\  RBP}_t$ (this will become relevant soon). Taking into account that there are 2880 epochs in a day, 5 blocks per epoch (on average), and that the current target block size is 5 Billion gas units, it follows from the previous equation that the *proportion of target block used* by M&O messages at any epoch $t$ can be approximated by", "metadata": {}}}
