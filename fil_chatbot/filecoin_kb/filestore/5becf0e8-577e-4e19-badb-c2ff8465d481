In this setting, one could, e.g., dedicate a subnet to all FVM-related transactions and keep the parent network for all storage-related messages. Unfortunately, however, the timelines for these projects do not overlap. Should the gas lane solution be implemented, an interesting crypto-economic question would be to investigate the potential effects induced by this migration. \n\n\n# Appendix A1. Characterising demand\n\nThere are two possible approaches to characterising demand in our setting. We begin by introducing some necessary notations and then describe these two characterisations. We will assume that there are $N_c$ different classes of messages, each with its own demand function. In the Filecoin network, one such classification could be, e.g., \n* i. Proofs of space-time (`submitWindowPoSt`).\n* ii. Onboarding/PoRep proofs (e.g., `PreCommitSector` and `ProveCommitSector`) \n* iii. F(E)VM messages.", "metadata": {}}}
