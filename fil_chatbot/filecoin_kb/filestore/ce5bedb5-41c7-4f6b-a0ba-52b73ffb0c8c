Notice that the sensitivity equation above is a partial derivative; it tells us how the $\\ell$-th output is changing, on average, with respect to the $j$-th input parameter, assuming that the other $N-1$ input parameters are fixed. As a reminder, a positive (resp. negative) sensitivity implies that the function is increasing (resp. decreasing) with respect to the input parameter' the further the value deviates from zero in either direction, the stronger the rate of change will be. \n\nConsidering that all the observed quantities evolve over time, we've represented the sensitivity of a particular amount with respect to time and the corresponding parameter graphically.", "metadata": {}}}
