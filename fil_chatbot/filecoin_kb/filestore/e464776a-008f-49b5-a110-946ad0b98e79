Bandwidth \u2014 Number of bytes transferred from Saturn to its end users, in a given time-interval. This is the main metric we want to score as it encodes the network's \u201cusage\u201d and is the main driver of costs for node operators.\n2. Time-to-first-byte (TTFB) and total download time \u2014 one of the behaviors we wish to see in Saturn is a fast content delivery and, as such, the speed of the content delivery is an important incent vector. One way we can measure it is through the TTFB and total download time recorded by the end-user. Note that since we do not yet collect logs from the end-users, we will need to estimate the average TTFB and the download speed using a sample of requests performed by the orchestrator. In addition, the clients onboarded (aka the content publishers) will be able to collect both metrics, so we can also leverage their logs to estimate the average TTFB and download speed.", "metadata": {}}}
