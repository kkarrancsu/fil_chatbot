We can observe this in the figures below, which show the circulating supply trajectories over a 3-year period, under the designed scenarios. The combined scenario corresponds to the case when all three axis (token price, network usage and staking sentiment) have the same scenario. Note that each plot shows the average and standard deviation for each scenario.", "metadata": {}}}
