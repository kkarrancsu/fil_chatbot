However, here we are focussing on what *actually* matters to end users, which is TTFB and total download speed. In the cache hit ratio example, the higher the cache hit ratio, the lower the TTFB will be, which is the metric already being rewarded.\n\n\n**Reliability**\n\nNodes leaving the network degrade the network performance and experience for users. For example, when a node goes down, it can take up to 60 seconds for that node to be detected as down and removed from the network. Saturn's service worker can recover gracefully, albeit with degraded performance. Dumb clients without ARC's service worker can't, and their requests may fail.\n\nAs such, we want to introduce a mechanism for nodes to gracefully tell the network they will be going offline. If a node goes offline not gracefully, we need to penalize the node. If it goes offline gracefully, we still want to penalize it, although less than going ungracefully.", "metadata": {}}}
