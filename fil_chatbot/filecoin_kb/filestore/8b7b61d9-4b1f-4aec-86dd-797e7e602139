This is in line with the simulated behavior of operators, where each day there is a new inflow of operators and, as a consequence, an observed growth in total bandwidth served.\n \nIn both cases, daily deployed capital takes some days to reach its stable trend. This is caused by the withholding of rewards to build the collateral balance of new operators.\n\nIt is also important to note that the scoring functions don't seem to have a meaningful impact on daily deployed capital, while the penalty multipliers do have an impact. This is expected since higher penalty multipliers lead to higher overall penalties and, thus, lower aggregate rewards.\n\n The next two plots show the daily reward paid on average to a single operator (split by type of operator).\n\n| Constant reward pool                          |\n| --------------------------------------------- |\n| ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkbCw6cXi.png) |", "metadata": {}}}
