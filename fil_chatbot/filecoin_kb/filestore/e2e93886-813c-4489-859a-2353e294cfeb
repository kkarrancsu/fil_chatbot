Here we used a statistical approach to estimate the marginal dependences and the sensitivity of each individual parameter on the economic metrics.\n- A Monte Carlo simulation analysis, where we ran various Monte Carlo simulations based on the MechaQredo model for different combinations of parameters and scenarios, and we analyzed the tradeoffs of each parameter when considering key economic metrics such as circulating supply, supply inflation, and profitability of the Staking Model. \n\nIn the next subsections, we will detail the results of each analysis. However, before doing that, we need to provide an overview of the MechaQredo model and the scenarios we used in both analyses.\n\n\n### 2.1 MechaQredo and scenarios\n\nThis subsection is based on [this dedicated report](/5EBNVwwLRBuhXy9wW4oTiw).\n\n**MechaQredo**", "metadata": {}}}
