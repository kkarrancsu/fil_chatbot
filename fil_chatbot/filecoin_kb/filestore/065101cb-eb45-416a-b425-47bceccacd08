This value is low enough to support the operation of Qredo LLC, while maintaining an appropriate flow of funds locked in the Ecosystem Fund.\n- Set the validator reward share to 70% to maintain strong APRs for Stakers while ensuring sufficient profits for Validators.\n- Set the vesting decay rate to a 2-year half-life: $\\frac{\\ln{2}}{2 \\times 365}.$ This rate is not too aggressive to supply inflation rates while allowing for a good complement to staking rewards.\n- Use a release rate function with a maximum rate $r_\\text{max}$ of 0.0006 and an exponent $a$ of 0.8 to provide sustainable rewards for Stakers and Validators while maintaining the balance of the Ecosystem Fund.\n\n\n## 3.
