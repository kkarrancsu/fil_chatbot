Furthermore, we assume this probability decreases with $b_t$, and becomes *small* whenever $v_m<0$. \n\n- **Assumption 3.** We consider a suffciently short time horizon so that the changes in $\\mathbb{E}[G_t]$ and $\\mathbb{E}_m[R_t]$ (with respect to time) are negligible.\n\n- **Assumption 4.** The average gas spenditure of miner $m$ is proportional to its network power. \n\n- **Observation 1.** The base fee can typically vary through several orders of magnitude.", "metadata": {}}}
