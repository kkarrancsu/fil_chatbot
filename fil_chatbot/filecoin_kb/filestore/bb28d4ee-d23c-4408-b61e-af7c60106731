The network is below the baseline function and the new bandwidth being added will not reach the baseline.\n2. The bandwidth been added is not significantly superior to the average bandwidth per operator. This assumption is needed because reward growth sublinearly with bandwidth. This means that if the an operator serves more bandiwdth than the network's average, they will not receive proportionally more rewards.\n3. The performance of the L1 node operator in terms of download speed and uptime is exactly the same as the network average.\n\nWith this in mind, we only need to estimate the final bandwidth served by the node operator in a month. The final bandwidth will depend on two main factors, namely:", "metadata": {}}}
