In the 5/5/20 case, QAP BLC is pushed out for all considered cases of Fil+ onboarding rate after network upgrade. For the 5/5/10 and 2.5/2.5/10 options, if the Fil+ rate stays at current levels or drops slightly, QAP BLC is still pushed out.  However, if Fil+ rates drop significantly, this brings forward the QAP BLC. \n* Circulating Supply\n    * Larger multipliers result in increased locking, but the effect is less transitory if there is an associated increase in onboarding.\n* Fiat ROI\n    * The 5/5/10 option reduces the relative gap between CC and Fil+ sectors the most, and consequently, this option has the biggest boost in Fiat ROI for CC and RD miners. \n    * The 5/5/20 option increases absolute Fiat ROI for all sector types the most.", "metadata": {}}}
