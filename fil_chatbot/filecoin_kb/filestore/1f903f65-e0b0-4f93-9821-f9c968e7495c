The first one is that, as we increase the number of blocks in the average, the distribution of $\\widehat{G}^B_t$ starts becoming increasingly more concentrated around 0. This should not be a surprising fact given that the average value of $\\tilde{G}_t$ is close to 0. It is also important to notice here that, as we increase $B$, the distribution of  $\\widehat{G}^B_t$ increasingly resembles that of a Gaussian. \n\n\n\nLastly, we define the $B$-*censored normalized gas consumption* as $$\\mathring{G}^B_t:=\\tilde{G}_{B\\times t},$$\ni.e., the process $\\{\\tilde{G}_t\\}_{t\\geq0}$ observed every $B$ blocks. Similarly, as before, we plot $\\mathring{G}^B_t$ for $B\\in\\{2, 10, 20, 60, 120\\}$, which yields the following results:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/gqunuoW.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/0ZyB4q1.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1v5yHy7.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LBHHyrD.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yrzftPM.png)", "metadata": {}}}
