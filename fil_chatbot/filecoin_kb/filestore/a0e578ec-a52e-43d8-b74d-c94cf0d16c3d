The team defined a baseline function that determines the expected level of growth for the network. The tokens reserved for Baseline minting are only distributed if the network as a whole achieves or goes beyond that predefined growth goal. Thus, if storage providers don\u2019t onboard storage at the expected rate, the network will not mint at full speed and the total rewards distributed will be lowered. When the network achieves the growth goals, tokens are minted at full capacity and follow a \u201cnormal\u201d exponential decay.", "metadata": {}}}
