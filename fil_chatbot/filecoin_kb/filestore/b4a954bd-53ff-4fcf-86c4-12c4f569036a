We approach this from an upper-bound perspective since the simulations above terminate fractions of the overall power. \n\nThe maximum possible burn due to terminations is 36,711,768 FIL, about 6% of the circulating supply if all network power is terminated. This presents some friction to termination but is low in the context of the entire circulating supply.\n\nRefer to [this notebook](https://github.com/protocol/filecoin-agent-twin/blob/main/notebooks/terminations/dca_terminate_oneagent.ipynb) for further details.", "metadata": {}}}
