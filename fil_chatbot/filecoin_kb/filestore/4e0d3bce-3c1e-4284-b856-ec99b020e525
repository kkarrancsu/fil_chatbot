These mathematical representations of preference consist of a sigmoid function parametrized by a \"rate factor\" that determines how fast the amount of demanded gas decays as a function of price, and a \"threshold factor\" that represents the price that a service provider would be \"comfortable\" to pay on average. Since these values represent a highly subjective measure of choice for each miner, we formulated them as random variables with known distributions. This accounts for the subjectivity of these values and produces better and more robust estimates of subsequent quantities of interest using Monte Carlo methods.", "metadata": {}}}
