The rate of utilization of certain datasets (e.g., Landsat 8) through Bacalhau processes should be easy to determine and directly reflect impact. (2) the number of nodes offering compute including nodes offering GPU compute (3)  new storage based on Bacalhau processes; (4) number of unique wallets executing a job, a measure of how widespread the use of Bacalhau is, (5) number of jobs executed.  Note that this metric may be corrupted if users resubmit jobs because of network failure or Bacalhau-related errors, (6) number of cores on the network, a measure of network power, and (7) number of storage providers participating\n\n## Outstanding Questions", "metadata": {}}}
