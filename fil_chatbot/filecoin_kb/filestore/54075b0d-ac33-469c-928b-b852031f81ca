Enable SPs to onboard or extend power with less pledge than the full initial pledge required, subject to the constraint that an SP will be required to put up atleast $2/3$ of a sector\u2019s pledge. Said differently, an SP can choose to pledge up to $1/3$ less than the sector's initial pledge; we define   this amount to be the shortfall.\n2. Regardless of shortfall taken, all sectors will have the same full QAP an will earn rewards commensurate with sector power \n3. A fraction of rewards earned and/or vested will be taken to either lock as pledge or burn as a fee; this fraction reduces as the shortfall is closed. \n\nThe result is an SP can onboard more power for a given amount of pledge tokens. This could raise FIL-on-FIL returns, however, the mechanisms are designed such that if an SP is not pledge constrained, they would prefer to commit sectors with the full initial pledge amount (i.e. take no shortfall).", "metadata": {}}}
