This is sensitivity. For example, if you incrementally increase the protocol funded rate by 1%, and each time you see a corresponding decrease of 10 tokens in the circulating supply, you could say that the sensitivity of circulating supply to the protocol funded rate is -10 tokens per percent increase in the protocol funded rate.", "metadata": {}}}
