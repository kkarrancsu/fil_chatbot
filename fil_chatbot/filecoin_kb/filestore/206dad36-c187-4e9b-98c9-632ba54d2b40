It is defined as $i(t) = \\frac{C(t)-C(t-1)}{C(t-1)}$.\n- **Yearly supply inflation rate**: measures the rate of token supply increase each year. It is defined as $I(t) = \\frac{C(t)-C(t-365)}{C(t-365)}$.\n\n\n### Fee model variables\n\nTo extract more information from the Fee Models Design, the simulation will need to track two additional variables. These variables can be easily derived from the equations we defined in the previous section:\n\n- The number of tokens burned from protocol fees: $B_\\text{fee}(t) = f \\cdot N_\\text{trx}(t)$\n- The total amount of QRDO tipped to the network from service fees: $L_\\text{fee}^\\text{in}(t) = \\theta(1-\\gamma) \\cdot A_\\text{fees}(t)  P(t)^{-1}$\n\n### Staking model variables", "metadata": {}}}
