The precise relationship governing sector quality is given by:\n\n$$ SectorQualityMultiplier = \\frac{\\sum_{deals} DealWeight * DealQualityMultiplier}{SectorSpaceTime} $$\n\n$SectorQualityMultiplier$ captures the amount of useful data that a sector is serving and is used when computing a storage provider's (SPs) quality adjusted power (QAP).  In the current implementation, $DealQualityMultiplier = 10$. This equates to deal bytes from verified clients receiving a 10x multipler when computing sector QAP, while regular deal and CC sectors receive 1x QA multiplier.\n\nIn this report, we consider the implications of adding an additional multiplier applied to all sector types that provides an additional incentive for longer sector durations, and consequently helping fulfill Filecoin's mission: to be a long-term and robust foundation for humanity's information.", "metadata": {}}}
