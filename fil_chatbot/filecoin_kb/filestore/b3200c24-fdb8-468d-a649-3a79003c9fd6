Instead, the L2 solutions launch new instances of their solution.  There is no consensus mechanism for an L2 solution.*  \n\n***Optimism***\n\nCurrently, Optimism runs the sole Sequencer on Optimism.  While this approach is centralized, Optimism aims to decentralize the Sequencer over time, eliminating its role entirely so that anyone can participate in the network as a block producer.  Optimism intends to support multiple concurrent sequencers by adopting a standard BFT consensus protocol, as used by other L1 protocols and side chains like Polygon and Cosmos.\n\n### Native tokens", "metadata": {}}}
