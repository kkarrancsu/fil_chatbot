This affects a sector\u2019s quality-adjusted power, which in turn, impacts the initial pledge, leading to faster growth in percentage locked value (Figure 3B). The tradeoff is that while higher slope means the duration incentives are more effective, and give more favorable locked supply dynamics, this is constrained by collateral availability, and SP returns (section below).\n\nAn important additional point is that higher percentage locked value can be selected for directly. Without relying on duration changes, increasing the Initial Consensus Pledge target multiplier will increase the percentage value locked, as in Figure 3C. This gives an additional independent path to achieve more sustainable supply dynamics and encourage long-term data storage.", "metadata": {}}}
