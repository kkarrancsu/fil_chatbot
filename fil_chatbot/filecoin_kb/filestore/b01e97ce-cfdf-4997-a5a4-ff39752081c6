The projects also highlights GPU-heavy computation. Examples applications include **graphical rendering** with Blender and **deep learning**. An important selling point is the claim of **no specific size or time limits on computation**.\n\n**Economics**\n\nGLM is the utility token for the Golem economy that allows providers to earn GLM for providing compute paid for by users.  Golem uses Polygon MATIC for gas computations.  The requestor agent and compute provider interaction is via a market in the GLM token.  The market relies on reputation.  Compute cost is currently 0.025GLM/cpuhr or $0.01/cpuhr.\n\n**Additional reading**", "metadata": {}}}
