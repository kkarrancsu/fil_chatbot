In this framework, a new validator is assumed to join the network after a certain time period, $T_\\text{val}$. Here, $T_\\text{val}$ is an independent random variable with an exponential distribution parameterized by $\\lambda_\\text{val}$, representing the expected number of days between two validators joining the network (i,e, $\\lambda_\\text{val} =1$ implies that, on average, there's a new validator joining the network every day, while $\\lambda_\\text{val}=30$ means that there's a new validator joining the network every month). This rate can be made to depend on factors such as, e.g., token price, to reflect scenarios such as having validators joining the network at a faster rate whenever the price is high. Such models are extensively utilized in the analysis of queuing systems.", "metadata": {}}}
