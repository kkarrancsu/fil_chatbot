When the transaction is executed, the protocol takes the protocol fees from the user's wallet and burns them.\n\nOn the other hand, protocol-funded transactions and control transactions cannot be directly charged to a user's wallet. Instead, the protocol fees for these transactions need to be covered by an Ecosystem Fund that is fully controlled by the protocol. The fund will be financed by a token allocation from the unvested QRDO pool and a cut of the service fees collected by the protocol. **The exact QRDO allocation and service fees cut will be defined in the second phase of this project**.\n\n\n### How are fees computed?\n\nAt the moment, all transaction types have similar computation costs for the network. Here are some differences, but they are not significant (can we link here the analysis made by the Qredo team?).", "metadata": {}}}
