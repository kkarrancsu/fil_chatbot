We define $S_t$ to be the **circulating supply** at time $t$, or the number of tokens that are available at a given time. We define $P_t$ to be the **token price**, at a given time $t$, in terms of USD, such that $1{\\rm TOKEN}=P_t \\,{\\rm USD}$. We then define the $C_t$ to be the **market cap**, defined as,\n$$ C_t=P_t*S_t,$$\nwhich provides some quantification of the total value of the currency as a whole.", "metadata": {}}}
