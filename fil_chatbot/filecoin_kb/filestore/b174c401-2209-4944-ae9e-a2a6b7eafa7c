If they pay in QRDO, these fees are directly pooled into the Ecosystem Fund, which will be later distributed among network participants (i.e. Validators, Stakers, Developers, etc.). If they pay in fiat, these fees will be used to buy QRDO, and only then will they be deposited in the Ecosystem Fund.\n\nSince QRDO payments involve less work to the protocol, fees paid in QRDO are entitled to a discount. The discount will depend on the estimated costs of fiat-to-QRDO conversion and will be a key parameter of the service fee model.\n\nAnother important mechanism is the fiat-to-QRDO conversion strategy. Which service will be used to buy QRDO? Is it internal to the economy or external? How frequently will the conversion be? And what stakeholder is responsible for the conversion operations?", "metadata": {}}}
