We observe that:\nSlight differences in the minting rate and total QA power at the lowest points contribute to the absolute value of differences between terminations and leaving the network.\nThis is due to differences in how the ROI agents behave in the two cases. In the termination case, the agent\u2019s ROI estimate toggles above and below the threshold (likely due to estimation algorithm implementation). The toggling is reflected in the pledge/32GiB plot, which shows in the terminate cases that pledge toggles - this is due to the agents toggling between onboarding and not onboarding due to their ROI estimates. In the leave case, the agents do not toggle.", "metadata": {}}}
