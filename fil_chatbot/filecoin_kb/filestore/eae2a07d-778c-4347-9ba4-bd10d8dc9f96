The total gas limit from each class of message is given by $G_{\\ell,t}\\leq w_\\ell$. \n2. The base fee for each lane gets updated according to the price-update function in Equation (1). \n\n\nUnder the scenario outlined above, we would need to define $3\\times L$ parameters, namely $\\{w_\\ell,B_{\\text{target},\\ell},p^\\text{min}_\\ell\\}_{\\ell=1}^L$. **These parameters would need to be defined from the begining of the implementation, and might need to get adjusted over time.**", "metadata": {}}}
