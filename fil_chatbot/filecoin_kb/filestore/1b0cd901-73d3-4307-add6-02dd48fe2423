That is, defining by $B_i$ the amount of block space allocated to class $i$, $i=1,2,\\dots,N_c$,  one should have that $B_1+B_2+\\dots+B_{N_c}=B$, with $B$ the current block size. These block space allocations are called * gas lanes*, and we will refer to the size of $B_i$ (in terms of gas units) as its width. \n\nEach gas lane is, in turn, endowed with its own Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM). Such a TFM can be, e.g., $N_c$ different EIP1559-like TFMs, each having a separate base fee, or one could consider the same base fee for all lanes.", "metadata": {}}}
