We refer to this scenario as *block space gentrification*. \n\nIn these notes, we properly pose this problem and discuss some potential solutions. A detailed, more technical analysis of (i) the characterisation of demand, (ii) the quantities that will be most affected by this change in demand,  and (iii) some proposed methodologies are discussed in the Appendix. \n\n\n## Problem statement.", "metadata": {}}}
