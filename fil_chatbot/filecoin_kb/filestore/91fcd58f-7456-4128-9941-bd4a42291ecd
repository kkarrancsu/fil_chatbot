In general, however,  different sectors will have different (random) parameters that will in turn affect their profitability and/or our formulation, as in this case, the solution $x^*_i$ to Problem 2 for sector $i$, would be itself a random variable. In this case, one would then need to do a Monte Carlo on $x^*_i$. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Potentially relevant datasets\n\nThe following datasets might be relevant:", "metadata": {}}}
