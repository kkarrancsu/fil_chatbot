Conclusion\nOur analysis indicates that Filecoin\u2019s overall minting will be well above simple minting in the near future. If current onboarding and renewal rate trends continue, we expect total minting to approach simple minting on 2026-03-18 (median forecast), with a 90% credible interval between 2024-12-01 and 2028-02-20. In the most pessimistic counterfactual scenario, the earliest date when total minting may approach simple minting is late 2024. Positive changes in the macroeconomic between now and late 2024 can occur, leading to that date being pushed further into the future.  For example, if Raw Byte onboarding and Renewal Rate approach 55% of their historical maximum (35 PiB/day and 55%, respectively), total minting approaches within 2% of simple minting around January of 2027.", "metadata": {}}}
