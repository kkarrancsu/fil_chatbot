In the Investment Conservation scenario (solid lines), RB onboarding and renewal rate are extended by their historical values in the 1Y case, and scaled by the corresponding sector duration multiplier in the 3Y and 5Y cases (see Fig 2). In the Data Conservation scenario (dashed lines), data onboarding is maintained and duration multipliers act on top of this assumption. In each FIL+ rate is kept at 60% to reflect current network trends, and SDM slopes of 0.285x and 1x are simulated. ROI is pre-costs.*\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1j80fSAs.png)", "metadata": {}}}
