When a transaction or an operation is proposed in the network, Federated Nodes run an agreement protocol amongst themselves. This could involve a voting system where most votes determine whether a proposed operation is validated. If the proposal secures a sufficient number of votes (often more than 50%), it's accepted and included in the ledger. Rewards are then distributed among these nodes and, potentially, the token holders. \n\n\n### Delegated Proof-of-Stake", "metadata": {}}}
