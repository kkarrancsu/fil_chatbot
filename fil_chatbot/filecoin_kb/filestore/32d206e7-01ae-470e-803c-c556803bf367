It works by connecting Requestors (buyers) and Providers (sellers).  Golem splits the request into smaller parts of the initial task and rents the computing power from multiple users on the network.  The company does not provide detail about how the splitting of the task occurs.  It appears that the requestors fill out a template. Golem also places the control over the P2P market into users\u2019 hands, connecting Requestors and Providers based on the task template. Providers get paid directly for their services.  \n\n**Context**", "metadata": {}}}
