Tuning and validation phase\n    - This phase will last one more month \u2192 until the end of June\n    - During this phase, we will focus on validating and tuning the initial tokenomics design. We will build models and simulations to test the design against different economic scenarios and we will tune the main parameters based on pre-defined success metrics (to be iterated with the team)\n    - The main deliverable of this phase will be the **final tokenomics report** that can be shared with the community. The report will contain the technical details and the results obtained from the simulation. It will also provide the final parameter values.", "metadata": {}}}
