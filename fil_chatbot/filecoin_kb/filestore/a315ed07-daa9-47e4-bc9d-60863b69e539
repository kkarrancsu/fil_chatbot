With the previously defined value distributions, the equilibrium base fee is given by\n$$r^{\\rm eq}=F^{(-1)}\\left(1-\\frac{B^T}{B_M}\\right)$$\n\n\nWe now find the equilibrium base fee with our proposed mechanism, in the simple case where we assume the target being maximized is total network revenue, or $T_t= \\sum_{j\\in B\\in M}rg_j$\n\nThis calculation is done in two steps, first we calculate what would be the equilibrium target block size, which is the one that maximizes $T_i$ for a given constant demand, and then calculate the equilibrium base fee for that target block size.", "metadata": {}}}
