It terminates all existing power on the termination date and stops onboarding and renewing power after termination. The main difference between the leave and terminate variants is that `DCAAgentLeaveNetwork` lets sectors expire while `DCAAgentTerminate` actively terminates existing sectors.\n\nBecause the `DCAAgentLeaveNetwork` agents leave the network gracefully, it does not incur termination fees. The `DCAAgentTerminate` sustains termination fees. Both agent types are configurable to be FIL+ SPs, CC SPs, or Mixed. \n\n## 3. Experiments", "metadata": {}}}
