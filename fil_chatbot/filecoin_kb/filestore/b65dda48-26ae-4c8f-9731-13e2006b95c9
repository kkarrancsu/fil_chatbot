For each scenario, we compare the QAP trajectories to the baseline and the pledge.  Additionally, under the assumption of 5 USD/FIL, we compute the investment needed to onboard the defined amount of power.  These trajectories are shown below in Fig 8. Fig 9 shows the total investment needed to sustain the onboarding, renewal rate factor, and Fil+ rate factor shown.  An X in the heatmap indicates that that particular configuration reaches or exceeds the baseline in 1Y.", "metadata": {}}}
