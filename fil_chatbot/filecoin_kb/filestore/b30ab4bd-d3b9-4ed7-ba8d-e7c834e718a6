Concretely:\n\n$$\nC(t) = \n    C(t-1) \n    + V(t) \n    + L^\\text{out}(t) \n    - L^\\text{in}(t) \n    - B(t)\n$$\n\nNow, let's look at each of the components of the circulating supply.\n\n#### Tokens burned\n\nIn Qredo, tokens are burned to cover protocol fees, which are defined as a fixed fee per transaction. In addition, we are considering the option of burning a discretionary amount of tokens to fix a potential supply imbalance. Thus, the number of tokens burned at step $t$ is given by:\n\n$$\nB(t) \n    = B_\\text{fee}(t) + B_\\text{extra}(t) \n    = f \\cdot N_\\text{trx}(t) + B_\\text{extra}(t) \n$$", "metadata": {}}}
