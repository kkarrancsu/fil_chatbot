In reality a distribution of sector durations exists now and a different distribution will exist in a post SDM future.\n* **Assumption 2:** future protocol changes are out of scope. Example: termination fees may increase in the future but this not accounted for in this analysis.\n* **Assumption 3:** Introducing a SDM is modelled through a change in average sector duration across the network, and this change happens on top of the forecasted FIL+ rate, raw byte power growth and renewal rate. This means we are assuming the size of Filecoin\u2019s economy is not conserved, it has the potential to increase through longer average durations increasing network QAP.", "metadata": {}}}
