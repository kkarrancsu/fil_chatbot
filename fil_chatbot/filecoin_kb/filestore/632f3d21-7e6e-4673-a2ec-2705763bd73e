What differentiates Filecoin from these other networks is that Filecoin enables a variety of use cases. It supports both 1) SPs that store data on the network (FIL+ SPs) and 2) SPs that provide consensus security and storage capacity to the network (CC SPs). This flexiblity enables Filecoin to fulfill its mission of \u201cstoring humanity\u2019s most important data.\u201d FIL+ SPs utilize the 10x multiplier subsidy to help pay for additional associated costs, while enabling important data to be onboarded (examples include SETI, CERN, etc ...). Conversely, CC SPs help to secure the network and simultaneously create capacity that can be utilized to store data in the future (whether through RDs or through FIL+), rather than provide consensus for the sake of consensus. This flexibility and co-existence of CC and FIL+ mining has led to the massive amount of data stored on Filecoin. When compared", "metadata": {}}}
