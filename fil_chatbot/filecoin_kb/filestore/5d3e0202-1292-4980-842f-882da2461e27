Conclusions\nFilecoin\u2019s economy is designed to protect the network against adverse shocks. The primary mechanism for this is the interaction between how rewards are distributed and the pledge needed to participate in the network. If participants leave or terminate the network, then rewards for the remaining participants become more concentrated. If reward concentration increases, the total expected rewards per sector exceed the pledge, and FoFR increases, creating strong economic incentives to join and participate in the network.  \n\nWhile the network creates this as an enabling factor, the actual network recovery still depends on SPs. The SPs must: 1) recognize the incentives and 2) take advantage of them by onboarding power, which requires them to have pledge collateral. The simulations above show a possible outcome when the economic incentives, post-shock, are taken advantage of.", "metadata": {}}}
