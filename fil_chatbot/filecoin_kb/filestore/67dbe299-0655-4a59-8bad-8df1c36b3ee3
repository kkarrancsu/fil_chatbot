Using 120 days of historical data, we first create forecasts of possible onboarding, renewal rate, and Fil+ rate trajectories.  This is shown in Fig. 1, below.\n\nWe observe that the median forecasted onboarding rate and Fil+ rate is on a decreasing trend, while the median renewal rate is on a slightly increasing trend. The 25th and 75th quantiles are shown in lighter shades, while the black trajectory represents the historical data.\n\nFor each of these trajectories, we then simulate the future state of the network using [MechaFIL](https://github.com/celtd/mechafil-jax), a digital twin of the Filecoin network. Fig 2-4 show the forecasted power, supply, and onboarding metrics.", "metadata": {}}}
