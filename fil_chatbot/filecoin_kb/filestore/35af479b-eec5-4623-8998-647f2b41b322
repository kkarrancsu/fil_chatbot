Since the deal collateral is an agreement between the storage user and the SP and does not depend on the quality multipliers, we will ignore it for now.\n\nAs for the net gain, it is the total rewards paid to the sector minus the gas fees paid to send the sector's proofs to the network.\n\nTherefore, the formula to the FoFR of a given sector is:\n\n$$FoFR = \\frac{R_{\\Sigma} - G_{\\Sigma}}{Pl_0}$$\n\nSince we are interested in computing how the quality multiplier impact FoFR, we will not go into more detail about the gas fees $G_{\\Sigma}$ since they do not depend on the sector's quality-adjusted power (QAP). We will, however, detail how the rewards $R_{\\Sigma}$ and the collateral $Pl_{\\Sigma}$ are impacted by the multipliers in the next two subsections.\n\n\n#### Sector rewards", "metadata": {}}}
