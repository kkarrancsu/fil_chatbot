In addition, sublinear or linear functions on bandwidth seem to be more desirable since they signal to the network a preference towards a low-concentration of resources and rewards. In the end, we want a rich network of many participants, coming together to share the load.\n:::\n\n### Incentivizing honesty\n\nWhen setting penalties for dishonesty, there are two main metrics that need to be considered - the true positive rate (i.e., the probability of a cheater being detected) and the false positive rate (i.e. the probability that an honest node is flagged as a cheater). Both of these metrics need to be estimated through known cases detected in the past.\n\nIf we have these two metrics, then we can define bounds for the penalty adjustment applied to single nodes using two main assumptions:", "metadata": {}}}
