Cianci, CryptoEconLab, July 2023\n\n\nIn previous reports, we have proposed a set of new tokenomic mechanisms to be introduced to Qredo, including two new [Fee Models](/v5r6y8a_TE6NtouVHmPnmA) aimed at increasing token utility, a [Staking Model](/Xh_biTXNS8mpG5M_rMfKbg) to support Qredo's introduction of a federated Proof-of-Stake consensus, and the [allocation and vesting](/3Xwe-CZ8TPiC80Fg2r5qtQ#New-allocation) of 1 billion tokens set aside originally when QRDO first launched.\n\nAll of these new mechanisms had a set of parameters that needed to be defined in such a way as to accomplish the following three high-level goals:\n\n1. The Staking Model should be sustainable for both Stakers and Validators.\n2. The supply inflation rates must be less or equal to the current levels experienced by the network.\n3. Token usage should be tied more closely to the growth and usage of the Qredo network.", "metadata": {}}}
