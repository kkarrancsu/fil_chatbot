Examples include withdrawals, transfers between Qredo Layer 2 (QL2) wallets, etc.\n- Protocol-funded transactions - Transactions initiated by protocol users without a QL2 wallet (i.e., the protocol is not capable of charging the protocol fees). Examples are wallet creation transactions or MPC-sign transactions for clients without a QL2 wallet.\n- Control transactions - Internal transactions that the Qredo network must execute to maintain operations. These transactions are not generated by protocol users. Instead, they are initiated by the protocol itself or by the development team when deploying protocol changes. Examples include fee collection, messaging, network upgrades, etc.", "metadata": {}}}
