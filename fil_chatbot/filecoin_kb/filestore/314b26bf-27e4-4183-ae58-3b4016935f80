The way this parameter impacts the decision of whether to stake tokens is quite straightforward. If the wallet has a balance greater or equal to the minimum staking amount, it will be \"eligible\" to stake. If not, that wallet (and its balance) will be excluded. We refer to the total amount of QRDO elligible for staking as $\\tilde{S}^\\text{in}$. This input can be estimated with the wallet balances data shared by the Qredo Team.\n- The second factor corresponds to how much each wallet holder is willing to stake initially. This is harder to model. For simplicity, we aggregate all the eligible wallets ($\\tilde{S}^\\text{in}$) and assume a given percentage of their token balances will be staked. We refer to this percentage as the initial staking conversion rate, or $\\delta^\\text{init}\\in (0,1)$. This rate is one of the variables we use to design the Stakers' decision scenarios.", "metadata": {}}}
