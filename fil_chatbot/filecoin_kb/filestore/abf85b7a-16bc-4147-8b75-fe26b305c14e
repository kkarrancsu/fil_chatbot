{"lc": 1, "type": "constructor", "id": ["langchain", "schema", "document", "Document"], "kwargs": {"page_content": "There are two main challenges associated with the mechanism above: \n\n- *Token dilution*. Continually releasing new tokens to reward holders without strongly incentivizing users to *lock* tokens (and effectively removing them from the circulating supply) can lead to *token dilution*. This means the total supply of tokens increases beyond its demand, which could decrease the value of individual tokens if demand does not rise proportionally. \n- *Centralized consensus*. Having a fully centralized consensus poses trust, security, and censorship-resistance risks, which are antithetical to Qredo's mission.  \n\nFurthermore, the QRDO token has a finite supply, which makes it difficult to sustain a fixed APY based solely on vesting throughout a long period of time.", "metadata": {}}}
