These messages are put into the chain's\u00a0*inbox.  Note:* Rollups are still susceptible to miners/sequencers being able to choose the order of transactions within blocks they produce.\n\nA single Ethereum block could include within it multiple Arbitrum blocks (if, say, the Arbitrum chain is getting heavy activity); however, an Arbitrum block cannot span across multiple Ethereum blocks. Thus, any given Arbitrum transaction is associated with exactly one Ethereum block and one Arbitrum block.\n\n### zkSync and zkPorter\n\nIn\u00a0**zkSync**\u00a0the cost of every transaction has two components: (1) the **Off-chain part (storage + prover costs)**: the cost of the state storage and the SNARK (zero-knowledge proof) generation. This part depends on the use of hardware resources and is therefore invariable. Our benchmarks give estimates of ~0.001 USD per transfer.", "metadata": {}}}
