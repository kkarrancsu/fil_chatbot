Under our considered model (i.e., a linear regression), one can write the (estimated) total gas used by M&O messages as a function of Raw Byte Power (RBP).\n    \nFrom this, we obtain the average proportion of gas used in a block, by taking the estimated total gas used by M&O messages and dividing it by the average number of blocks in a day (2880 epochs $\\times$ 5 Billion gas units as a target $\\times$ 5 blocks per epoch, on average). \n\nSince this is a proportion, it *should* returna number between 0 and 1. However, since the estimated total daily gas used by M&) messages is a linear function, it is not necessarily bounded between 0 and 1 (as we require for the priority factor); and as sucvh we resort to  using the min and max operators. \n</p>\n</p></span>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
