We find that all variants which propose reducing the multiplier to 1x, either immediately (**Option 1**) or through a defined schedule (**Option 2**, **Option 4**) threaten network consensus security. Additionally, we find that due to the reduction in cost dilution, incentives for new SPs to join the ecosystem are reduced in these options. An alternative approach to sunsetting the Fil+ program, whereby all new power is given the 10x multiplier has two advantages: 1) to maintain the locked collateral thereby contributing to the security of the network, and 2) to maintain incentives for new SPs to join the network. \n\n*Disclaimer: Do your own reasearch, this is not financial advice.*", "metadata": {}}}
