In this scenario, the client deposits Fil on the Filecoin network and then transfers FIL to CoD tokens at an exchange rate.  The client then offers a compute contract (along with CIDs) to the network.  A Thread Provider agrees to the contact and runs the threads.  After the threads are completed, the results are delivered to the client according to the contact and the Thread Provider is paid.  A gas fee is charged for the compute and the transactions back and forth.      \n\nAn alternative is using FIL as the token.  This makes sense because the initial target is Storage Providers who are already accustomed to FIL.  No bridging is necessary.  Because the Thread Providers are already Storage Providers, it is possible to use their existing pledge as collateral against slashing.  Alternatively, an additional pledge can be required.", "metadata": {}}}
