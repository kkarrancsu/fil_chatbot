This is implemented with a boost, a multiplier applied to the amount of onboarded power, for a given FoFR value.  For example, if historically, a CC SP onboarded 5 PiBs/day, if the NetworkFoFR was 30%, the 2x boost behavior means that same SP now onboards 10 PiB/day. We simulate boost values of 2x, and 3x. Relevant network KPIs are shown in Fig 7.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sy1YP2ORn.png)\n*Figure 7. Various scenarios explored to forecast the network state in the counterfactual scenario that Fil+ subsidy was never put forth.*\n\nThe takeaway from this experiment is even in the counterfactual scenario where Fil+ did not exist and agents onboarded 3x as much raw-byte power for a given FoFR, network would most likely have less overall raw-byte power, less minting and less locking than its current state.", "metadata": {}}}
