Two ways are: (i) by making the exponent dynamic, allowing it to change based on the level of shortfall, and (ii) introducing an additional burn fee that increases with shortfall uptake. \n\nBoth generalisations can in effect make shortfall progressively less attractive with the level of uptake. One indirectly through repayment dynamics without any additional cost (but through less favourable cash flow), and one explicitly through an additional fee rate component. \n\nWhile full specification of these generalisations is beyond the scope of this introductory spec, sketches for each are presented at the end.\n\n**Distribute rewards between burning, vesting, and immediate release:**", "metadata": {}}}
