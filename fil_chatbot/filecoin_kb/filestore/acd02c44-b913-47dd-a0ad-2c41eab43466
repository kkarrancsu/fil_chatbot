In order to investigate such a question, we fit $\\lambda_H$ for different values of $\\overline{G}$ in $[-1,1]$.  In all cases, we were able to see that the distribution of the interarrival times can be approximated with an exponential distribution relatively well (at least to the naked eye) and that the ACF decays to 0 almost immediately. We plot the values of the computed $\\lambda_H$  as a function of $\\overline{G}$. In the same plot, we perform a least-squares polynomial approximation of such a function, given by $$ \\lambda_H(\\overline{G})\\approx \\lambda^P_H(\\overline{G}):=-0.6096 \\overline{G}^4 + 0.7184 \\overline{G}^3 + 0.4776 \\overline{G}^2 - 1.001 \\overline{G} + 0.4422$$", "metadata": {}}}
