Whether the base fee blows up to such a considerable value depends (at least to some extent) on the miners. *Apriori*, given that (i) miners decide which messages --if any-- to include in a block and (ii) since at this current stage they make the majority of their profits from block rewards (and not tips), they can choose to send *empty (or almost empty) blocks* to reduce the base fee if they decide, as a group,  that such a value is currently too high. This poses an interesting game-theoretic question about the behavior of the miners (are they cooperative?) which should be analyzed further. \n\nWhile the 20 nanoFIL/gas unit is a valid threshold for when data onboarding stops, we also aim to understand the effects of base fee on onboarding (and hence, locking) in more depth. This will be the focus of upcoming work.", "metadata": {}}}
