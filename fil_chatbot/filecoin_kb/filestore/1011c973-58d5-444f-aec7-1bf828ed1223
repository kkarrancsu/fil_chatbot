If the rate is 0.0008, the fund will be halved at most in 2 years.\n    - Higher rates mean more rewards are distributed to Stakers and Validators (thus increasing their profitability). However, this comes at the cost of a faster reduction in the balance of the Ecosystem Fund.\n- Exponent $a$ overview:\n    - Controls how much to reward early adopters - the closer to 0 the more we reward early adopters at the cost of late adopters.\n    - When $a=1$, the release rate increases proportionally to the no. of validators and TVL.\n    - At lower values of TVL or validator count, lower $a$ increases the release rates and, as a consequence, there will be more rewards available early on.", "metadata": {}}}
