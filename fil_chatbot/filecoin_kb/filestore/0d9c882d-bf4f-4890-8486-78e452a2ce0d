This can be considered partially addressed by the assumption that a proposal in the near future will adapt termination fees if the SDM policy is implemented.\n\nFinally, while termination to re-onboard is wasteful and misaligned, its impact is likely to be limited, as illustrated by the extreme termination scenarios shown in Figure 1.\n\nA more extensive range of scenarios across examining different sector termination dates, sector SDMs, average network SDM, and sealing dates from different perspectives across each of the 4 macro scenarios is given in this [Notebook](https://github.com/protocol/CryptoEconLab-private/blob/qm-expansion/notebooks/quality_multiplier_expansion/all_vs_new_sectors/SP_Micro_Termination_Model.ipynb).\n\n\n## Assumptions and Limitations", "metadata": {}}}
