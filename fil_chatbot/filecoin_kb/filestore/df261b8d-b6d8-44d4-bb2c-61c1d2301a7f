Fig 5 and 6 show the change in FiatROI for sensitivities of 0.25 and 0.75, respectively. We observe a reduced (but still positive) incentive to cheat for the 5/5/10 proposal when compared to others in Table 1. This matches intuition because 5/5/10 maximizes closing the gap between FIL+ and CC. If slashing is introduced into the FIL+ program for cheating (V3-ExploitFIL+), all proposals except for 5/5/20 make cheating irrational. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B18emVeWa.png)\n*Fig 5: Change in FiatROI for each business profile and different multiplier configurations for a sensitivity of 0.25 and a 20% decrease in Fil+ rate onboarding.*\n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk5xXEl-6.png)\n*Fig 6: Change in FiatROI for each business profile and different multiplier configurations for a sensitivity of 0.75 and a 20% decrease in Fil+ rate onboarding.*", "metadata": {}}}
