This ratio is defined so that the maximum uplink of 100 Gbps leads to a total bandwidth of 45 TB per month, which is the cap we are assuming nodes will experience in the long run.\n\nThus, the final formula for the FIL earning is the following:\n\n$$I \\times R \\times C$$\n\nwhere:\n\n* $I = \\frac{800000}{54150}$: intrinsic value of 1 TB of bandwidth\n* $C = \\frac{\\text{uplink} \\cdot 60 \\cdot 60 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 30}{8 \\cdot 1000}$: maximum available capacity in TB. Note that we are dividing it by 8 to convert Gigabits into Gibabytes and we are dividing it further by 1000 to convert GB into TB. Note that we are diving it by 1000 to convert GB into TB.\n* $R = 0.00136$: traffic demand ratio derived above.\n\n\nTo make the formula more concrete, we implemented the calculator in python and generated the following plots:\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkxXMDVEs.png)", "metadata": {}}}
