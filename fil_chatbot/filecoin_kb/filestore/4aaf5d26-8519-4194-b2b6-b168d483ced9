Although simple, this formula allows for some flexibility rewarding the reward distribution, by varying $k$. The next figure plots the ratio of rewards given to a single node operator in relation to the ratio of bandwidth they contributed. Each line represents a different $k$.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"500\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x33K5sG.png\">\n<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n\nWith a supra linear scoring function ($k > 1$), rewards increase faster than the share of bandwidth contributed. This incents operators to rump up their service since they get increasingly more rewards by increasing the bandwidth they service. On the other hand, with a sublinear function ($k<1$), the share of rewards increases slower than the share of bandwidth provided. This incents a higher distribution of rewards since it gets ever harder to get a bigger share of rewards by serving more bandwidth.", "metadata": {}}}
