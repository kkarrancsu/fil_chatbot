Withdrawing from Qredo means that the L1 assets associated with the qAsset are unlocked and sent to the user's L1 wallet, while the qAsset is destroyed.\n\nIt is important to note that Qredo is not an exchange, meaning that there is no mechanism (centralized nor decentralized) to match sell and buy orders. Instead, users must find willing peers to trade with. To support this, the team is planning to launch the Liquidity Hub, which will function as public marketplace that contains a list of Qredo Swaps shared by users. Anyone can browse, select, and take swap quotes that suit their needs.\n\nCurrently, users of this service are primarily corporate and institutional clients. While Qredo does not charge service fees for Qredo Swapps, they charge for withdrawals. Withdrawals use the same fee model as external transactions. In fact, the entire trading activity is combined to derive the total 30-day billable volume.\n\n\n### Stakeholders", "metadata": {}}}
