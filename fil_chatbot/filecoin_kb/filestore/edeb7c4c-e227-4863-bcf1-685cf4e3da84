If in the future the pice will be cut into more slices, without it becoming a larger pie overall, then every holder will end up with a smaller slice of pie.\n\nWe define the *Asymptotic diluted price*, $P^A_t$ as the expected token price under the assumptions that 1) All the maximum circulating supply has been minted and 2) Market cap has not changed. At time $t$ this can be computed as,\n$$ P^A_t=\\frac{C_t}{S_{\\rm max}}$$\n\nThis Could give some idea to an investor of what would happen to their token investment eventually in the far future, if the project's market cap doesn't grow.\n\n\n## When thinking about the asymptotic future doesn't make much sense\n\nAn interesting counterexample that points to $P^A_t$ not being a good indicator to investors, is Ethereum, a currency that doesn't have a capped maximum supply.", "metadata": {}}}
