The tokens have exchange value outside of the network, based on the limited supply, and their demand as needed to support network services as network utility grows. Because the tokens have value, their distribution provides an incentive to grow capacity and onboard data storage, thereby bootstrapping the network\u2019s mission.", "metadata": {}}}
