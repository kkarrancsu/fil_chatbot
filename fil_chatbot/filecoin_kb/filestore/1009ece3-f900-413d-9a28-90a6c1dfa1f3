The original design of a growth pool assumed a linear adoption during a year, while, in reality, operators joined at a significantly faster rate.\n\nTherefore, Saturn now is at a stage where the network has good enough distribution and performance to increase the number of clients it can serve and it should shift focus from increasing supply to increasing demand.", "metadata": {}}}
