Incentives to terminate early and re-onboard when the average network duration is 3 years, and SDM policy is implemented in mid January 2023. Green (>0) means no incentive to terminate early to re-onboard.\n\nThis effect is more pronounced the greater the difference between typical sector duration and the short commitment, but the impact is mitigated by it requiring substantial deviation from what is the typical network duration. \n\nFurthermore, SDM acts to reduce the marginal costs contribution to ROI leading to incentives for longer commitments. The proportion of sectors committing for the shortest durations for this mechanism to be relevant is therefore expected to be low.", "metadata": {}}}
