If we refer to Unit Ecnonomics above, under this regime $N_B > N_S$. The per unit cost for batching is strictly greater than the per unit cost for single proofs. \n\nUnder this condition, the *SingleProofProveCommit* method is preferred. \n\n### Case 2: $B > \\beta$\n\nHere, the network *BaseFee*, $B$ is strictly greater than the *BatchBalancer*, $\\beta$. We are interested in describing the conditions under which miners would prefer to batch rather than submit single proofs for their sectors:  \n\n$$ N_S - N_B > 0 $$\n\nSubstituting the unit economics definitions above, this is when: \n\n$$ g_sB  - (max\\{B,\\beta\\} * d * g_s + \\frac{g_bB}{M}) > 0 $$\n\nSince $B > \\beta$:\n\n$$ g_sB  - (g_sB*d + \\frac{g_bB}{M}) > 0 $$\n\nwhich reduces simply to $N_S > N_B$ when:\n\n$$ g_s(1 - d) - \\frac{g_b}{M} > 0 $$", "metadata": {}}}
