The block creation process follows a deterministic order, typically a round-robin schedule, **to avoid the competition seen in Proof-of-Work systems (in terms of power) or Proof-of-Stake (in terms of validator wealth)**. That block space is lost if a delegate does not create a block in its turn. Once a block is created, other delegates validate it. If the block is valid, it gets added to the blockchain, and the block creator, and potentially their electors, get a reward, often in the form of the native cryptocurrency.", "metadata": {}}}
