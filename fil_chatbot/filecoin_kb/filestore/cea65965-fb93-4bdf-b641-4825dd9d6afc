More concretely, rewards are more concentrated if the remaining SPs onboard less power. This is shown across the scenarios and within each scenario, where the percentage of SPs that terminate is modulated. Less reward concentration results from fewer SPs leaving the network. However, the economic incentives for onboarding are still powerful. The network recovers to its previous state faster when it terminates less power.\n\n\n### Differences between Gradually Leaving and Suddenly Leaving", "metadata": {}}}
