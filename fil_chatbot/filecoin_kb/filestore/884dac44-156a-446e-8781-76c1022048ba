These resources are paid for using a unit of cost called\u00a0**cycles**. Cycles are obtained by converting ICP tokens and are stored by each canister in a local balance.\n\nBy setting limits on how many cycles a canister can consume, the platform can prevent malicious code from completely taking over resources.  Cycles are intended to reflect the real cost of operations in a stable or deflationary way. The cost of program execution remains the same or decreases with operational efficiency. The conversion rate of ICP to cycles is adjusted based on the current ICP market value.\n\n**Tokens**", "metadata": {}}}
