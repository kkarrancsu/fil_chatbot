Vesting doesn't depend on the scenario while locking is highly influenced by the scenario. This is expected as the number of tokens locked depends on both staking sentiment and network usage. This is a reason why the optimistic scenario leads to a lower circulating supply and lower yearly inflation rates.\n\n\n### Staking Model\n\nThe second goal was to have a tokenomic design capable of supporting a sustainable Staking Model. This means that we need to ensure that both Stakers and Validators are properly incentivized to participate and that the model can be sustained in the long term.", "metadata": {}}}
