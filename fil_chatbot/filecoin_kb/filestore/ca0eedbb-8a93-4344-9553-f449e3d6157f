This may be useful for cases where we can easily define what is *impossible*.\n2. **Statistical outliers:** here we use real data from Saturn to model the statistical distribution of the underlying metric. This assumes that the data we have is \"normal\" and will be representative of future requests. Once we have the empirical distribution for the metric, we can set the threshold such that, with a certain statistical significance, all points falling outside are sampled from a different distribution.\n\nIn the end, we use a mixture of the two strategies.\n\nMore details about the heuristics and the log detection module in general, can be found in a [dedicated report](/WihFXzN9QteSwIxHW5zKeQ).\n\n## Reward calculator", "metadata": {}}}
