This, in turn, requires determining a minimum target gas usage $B^*_{\\ell,\\min}>0$.\n\n***Lane-adjusting mechanism**.* Due to its simplicity, we propose using the *Proportional allocation based on Raw Byte Power* as discussed above; indeed, this is an updated formula that can easily be computed using state data. **However, we are open to suggestions for either a more complex and more precise model.**\n\n***Multi-fee vs. discounted/adjusted gas lanes***.
