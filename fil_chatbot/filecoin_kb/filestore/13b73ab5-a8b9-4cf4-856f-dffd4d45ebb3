As for the `ProveCommitAggregate` and `PreCommitBatch`, their usage is more common whenever the base fee is large, as expected. Taking  their cyclical nature into account (batching is only reasonable whenever base fee is sufficiently high), there does seem to be some sligh upwards trend in their gas usage.", "metadata": {}}}
