It relies upon a few mild assumptions, but perhaps the most notorious one is that of *path continuity.* In simpler terms, this means that, although price will go through random alterations, as it does in reality, we eliminate the possibility of abrupt, drastic changes in price, often referred to as \"black-swan events\".\n\n In this model, the price process $\\left\\{P(t)\\right\\}_{t\\geq 0}$ satisfies the following Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE):\n \n m_\\text{fee}\n \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}P(t)}{P(t)}=\\underbrace{\\mu_\\text{token}\\mathrm{d}t}_\\text{deterministic drift}+\\underbrace{\\sigma_\\text{token}\\mathrm{d}W(t)}_\\text{random, volatile term}.\n\\end{aligned}", "metadata": {}}}
