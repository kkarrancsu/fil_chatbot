However, it is possible that the stream of new, FVM-related messages might take away valuable block space from those messages that are critical to the correct functioning of the network (so-called *control plane messages*), such as those related to data onboarding (`PreCommitDeposit`) and proof of storage over time (`SubmitWindowedPoSt`). This scenario could happen, for example, if FVM users consistently submit their messages with a substially larger bid that that associated with the control-plane messages$^1$. Given that storage providers might incurr a penalty for not submitting `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages on time, they will likely still try to submit their messages, even if the price (in terms of base fee and miner tip) is too high, as long as the cost of doing so is", "metadata": {}}}
