We find that the current trajectory of the network is towards shrinkage. For Network QAP to grow and catch back up to the baseline target, ~800M of investment will need to flow into the network. Investment flow into the network is the current primary bottleneck.  However, Filecoin was designed to be robust to downturns, and its anti-fragile mechanism of increasing FoFR to attract further investment is starting to be activated. However, to properly take advantage of this, bottlenecks to QAP growth should be addressed.\n\nAdditionally, the Locked and Locked/Circulating Supply trajectories should be monitored, since if the network continues to shrink these will reach levels that may threaten network consensus security.", "metadata": {}}}
