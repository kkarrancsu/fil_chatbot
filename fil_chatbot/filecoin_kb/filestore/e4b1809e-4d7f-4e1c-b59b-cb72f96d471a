Timelock encrypted mempools operate on the principle of revealing complete transaction data only after a pre-defined period of time, thus allowing users to conceal their transactions without using centralised relays and private mempools. A key consideration for this approach is to design a complementary mechanism of 1-block finality to avoid the possibility of [time-bandit attacks](https://www.mev.wiki/attack-examples/time-bandit-attack) and other malicious reorgs that seek to extract MEV by orphaning blocks. Osmosis mitigates this challenge by opting for a safety-favouring proof of stake consensus mehchanism where  all the validators vote on a block and if two-thirds of validators approve it, then the block is considered final.", "metadata": {}}}
