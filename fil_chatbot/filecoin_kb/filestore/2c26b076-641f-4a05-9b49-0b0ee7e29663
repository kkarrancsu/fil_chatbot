First, it can easily be extended to the case of more than two lanes. Furthermore, the gas requirements as a function of the state $X_t$ can be made more precise by computing how much gas is needed by `SubmitWindowPost.` Lastly, the choice of a single variable regression model was made due to simplicity. However, one could consider a model with several other predictor variables, such as e.g., *quality-adjusted power, baseline, circulating supply,*etc.   \n\n\n\n**Example mechanism: Proportional allocation based on average gas consumption**\n\nIn this mechanism, block space is allocated to each lane in proportion to its gas usage, thereby ensuring an equitable distribution of space and preventing the monopolization of resources by any single lane.", "metadata": {}}}
