We observe that the 5/5/20 option (green) uniformly decreases pledge, regardless of potential changes in RBP. The 5/5/10 and 2.5/2.5/10 options see pledge remain about the same as the status quo. Note that this depends on the Fil+ onboarding response. If Fil+ onboarding rate is reduced further than 20%, pledge increases from the status-quo. Conversely, if Fil+ onboarding rate is reduced less than 20%, the pledge converges further to the status-quo.\n\nThe associated FoFR plot is shown in Fig 3B. We see that FoFR follows the status-quo trajectory in the 5/5/10 and 2.5/2.5/10 cases. This happens until about 2025-07, but then turns upward due to the QAP BLC. Since the QAP BLC is pushed out further in the 5/5/20 option (green), the FoFR upward turn is not seen in the FoFR observation window in Fig 3B.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1p2W4lZ6.png)", "metadata": {}}}
