The result of overall Network QAP dropping is that the ratio of SPs QA to network QA increases for SPs who remain on the network. Thus, their rewards are more concentrated.\n    - This is observed in the Rewards/Sector plot.\n- Fil-on-FIL Returns (FoFR)\n    <!--     - In terms of FoFR, two effects are distinguished.  -->", "metadata": {}}}
