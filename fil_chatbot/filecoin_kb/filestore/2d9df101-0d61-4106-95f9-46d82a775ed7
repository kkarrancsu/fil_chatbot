In addition, the fees must be higher than 1 USD or 0.005% of the traded volume.\n\nAt the moment, we don't propose any change to the fee calculation formula. However, the fee model is flexible to accomodate different payment models (e.g. subcription models).\n\nNote that for the clients wishing to pay in QRDO, the protocol must employ an Oracle to incorporate the exchnage rate between USD and QRDO.\n\n\n\n<!--\n*From an old report:*", "metadata": {}}}
