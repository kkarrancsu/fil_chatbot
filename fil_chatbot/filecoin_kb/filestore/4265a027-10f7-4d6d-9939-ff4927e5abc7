Our key observations can be summarized as follows:\n- The average base fee increased post-FEVM, mostly oscillating around 0.2-0.6 nanoFIL/gas unit. Historically, this puts the current base fee above the 75% quantile. This range is about 1.5 orders of magnitude below the critical limit estimated before of 10nanoFIl gas per gas unit. We also did not detect any trend, hourly seasonality, or evidence it will keep increasing (or decreasing). \n- The statistical distribution of gas usage per block has remained relatively stable after the upgrade. However, we observe a slight shift in the proportion of full or almost full blocks, which helps explain the increase in the base fee. \n- Observing the tips to the miner associated with each kind of message, we observed that while a few FEVM messages had significantly larger miner tips, the majority did not tip substantially more than other methods.", "metadata": {}}}
