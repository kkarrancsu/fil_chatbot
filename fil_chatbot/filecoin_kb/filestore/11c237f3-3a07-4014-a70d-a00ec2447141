This leads to a lot of back and forth discussion on possible exceptions \u2014 what if client fee income were larger, what if staff costs were lower, and so forth.\n\nTo ameliorate this we can summarize possibilities by sampling from plausible prior distributions for each cost and income variable. These distributional assumptions are shown in Figure 3, and lead to the ranking of strategies shown in Figure 4. \n\nThe takeaways are: \n* For 80% of simulated cost and income scenarios, adopting V1-Exploit FIL+ is the best strategy. For the other 20%, FIL+ storage providing is the best. \n* These conclusions are broadly robust across a range of assumptions of token exchange rate, cost and income distributions, and multipliers, all of which can be varied using the interactive calculator.", "metadata": {}}}
