The low reward aspect relates to the fact that any prediction we are able to generate on the possible future net FVM gas demand is bound to be highly inaccurate.\n\nThe Filecoin network upon the launch of FVM will be an incredibly complex system, with many new teams and applications with different strategies coming onboard. While we could try to do a survey of planned upcoming applications and estimate their future gas usage, each of these estimates will be inaccurate, and there will be high uncertainty, with FVM projects that may launch or fail to launch without us being aware of them. This would be a **high effort option** that would require a large amount of surveying and data analysis. \n\nWe also consider option 1 to be **low reward**, in the sense that even if we manage to produce an accurate prediction of FVM gas usage, this may not be as valuable as spending the same effort in preparing the Filecoin network for **any** possible outcome.", "metadata": {}}}
