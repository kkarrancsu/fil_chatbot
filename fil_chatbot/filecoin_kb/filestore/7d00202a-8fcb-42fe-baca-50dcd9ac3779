When miners need to submit other types of messages, they will incur additional expenses, hence decreasing the threshold for $\\hat{b}_t$. \n* **From the previous bullet point, this value of 20 nanoFIL/gas units can be understood as a threshold for when it is not profitable for the miner to submit messages other than PoSt, including onboarding.**\n* It is important to note that this utility is given on an epoch-to-epoch basis. Having a handful of epochs in a day for which Condition I is not satisfied (and hence, the base fee is so high that it makes things unprofitable for the miner) is not catastrophic; however, having demand so high that this situation becomes the norm is concerning.", "metadata": {}}}
