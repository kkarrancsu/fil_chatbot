A sustained 2x increase in onboarding in response to the FIP passing can result in an increase of up to 10% in total minting from the status-quo.\n* Network QAP increases proportionally to the multiplier option considered; larger multipliers result in larger overall Network QAP. \n* The 5/5/20 option extends the timing of the QAP baseline crossing event. In the 20% Fil+ rate reduction scenario, QAP BLC remains about the same for the 2.5/2.5/10 and 5/5/10 options. However, if Fil+ rate decreases less than 20%, QAP BLC is still pushed out in these options. Conversely, if Fil+ rate decreases more than 20%, QAP BLC would be pulled further in. See the Appendix for further details.\n    * Note that Fig 1 is not a forecast of QAP BLC with Monte-Carlo simulations but a projection of the directionality of QAP BLC if QA multipliers are increased with FIP 883", "metadata": {}}}
