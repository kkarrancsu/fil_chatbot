Instead, They sign a traditional B2B agreement with Qredo\u2019s LLC and the Qredo team is responsible for billing and collecting the fees. In this situation, fees are not collected algorithmically by the protocol and thus Qredo LLC must do an extra step to transfer the value being generated there into the Qredo network.\n\nTherefore, Qredo clients will have two options when paying service fees - they either pay service fees in QRDO or fiat. If they pay in QRDO, these fees are directly pooled into the Ecosystem Fund, which will be later distributed among network participants (i.e. Validators, Stakers, Developers, etc.). If they pay in fiat, these fees will be used to buy QRDO, and only then will they be deposited in the Ecosystem Fund.", "metadata": {}}}
