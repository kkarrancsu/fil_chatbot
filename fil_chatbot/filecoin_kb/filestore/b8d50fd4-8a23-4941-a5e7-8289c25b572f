Motivation\n\nAs demand for the Filecoin-Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM) grows, it is in the Filecoin network's best interest to reserve a minimum amount of block bandwidth for messages that are critical to the functioning of the network, such as sector maintenance (e.g., `SubmitWindowPost`) and data-onboarding messages (e.g., `PreCommitStorage`).  Indeed, as it has been explored in [cite], if the amount of gas demanded by FEVM messages were to grow substantially to the point were FEVM users start submitting large miner tips in order to get their messages included in any given block,  then it is entirely possible that these *network-critical* messages might get *priced-out* and not be included. This is a phenomena that we have termed *gas gentrification*.", "metadata": {}}}
