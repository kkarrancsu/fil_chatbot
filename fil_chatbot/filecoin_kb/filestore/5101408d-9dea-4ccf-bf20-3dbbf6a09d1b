Communicating to different stakeholders the need to align on a given target.\n\n* Generating target-$D_{FVM}$ graphs for more complex targets, such as SP utility (including properly defining SP utility), as well as Data utility (understanding effects of the gas economy on data onboarding).", "metadata": {}}}
