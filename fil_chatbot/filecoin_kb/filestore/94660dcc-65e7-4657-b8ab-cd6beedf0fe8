This is an approximation, but, for our analysis, the conclusions should be close enough.\n\nIn this setting, the instanteneous issuance of new Filecoin tokens is defined as the derivative of the total number of tokens minted at time $t$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n  R(t) &:= \\frac{dM}{dt} \\\\\n  &= \\frac{dM_S}{dt} + \\frac{dM_B}{dt}\\\\\n  &= \\lambda \\cdot 0.3 \\cdot M_{\\infty} \\cdot e^{-\\lambda t} + \\frac{dM_B}{dt}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nThe first part of the equation (which relates to the simple minting) is independent of whether the network is above or bellow the baseline. However, the second component does depend on the network status reguarding the baseline and, as such, will be impacted if the network goes below.", "metadata": {}}}
