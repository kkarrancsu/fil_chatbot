In this setting, one chooses a set of *initial priority factors* $p_{\\ell,0}$ for $\\ell=1,2,\\dots,L$, satisfying $\\sum_{\\ell=1}^Lp_{\\ell,0}=1$, and keeps them fixed, i.e., $H_\\ell(p_{\\ell,t},X_t)=p_\\ell=p_{\\ell,t+1}$. While this offers a simple solution, we do not believe this is a rather valid approach, as it would require to be periodically adjusted to keep up with the gas requirements of the network. \n\n**Example mechanism: Proportional allocation based on Raw Byte Power (using linear regression)**\n\nA metric that is closely related to the size of the network is *Raw Byte Power (RBP)*. Indeed, as we can see from the figures below, there is a clear dependence between RBP and some of the most widely used messages (e.g., `ProveCommitSector,` `PreCommitSector,` `SubmitWindowedPost,` etc.). \n\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryCT1iton.png)", "metadata": {}}}
