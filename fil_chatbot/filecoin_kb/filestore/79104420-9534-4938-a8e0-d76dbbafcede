To improve efficiency, Aggregators will usually package together multiple client transactions into a single message to be submitted to the Arbitrum chain.  There is no requirement for the client to use an Aggregator.   There is also no limit on how many Aggregators can exist ****nor on who can be an Aggregator**.**", "metadata": {}}}
