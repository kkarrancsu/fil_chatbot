The scenarios where FIL+ rate decreases by either 0% or 50% are shown in the Appendix. Furthermore, note that the expected decrease in FIL+ rate (and consequently increase in CC sectors onboarded, due to total RBP being held constant) is a hypothetical that depends on individual SP cost profiles that determine their business direction. It is important to note that the 20% is not an expectation or a benchmark, but rather a modeling scenario. \n\n#### Power and Minting\nFig. 1 shows the Network RBP, QAP, and minting trajectories resulting from the policies outlined, for a 20% reduction in Fil+ onboarding rate.  The other scenarios (0% reduction, and 50% reduction) are shown in the appendix. The colors indicated by the legend in the plot show the specific multiplier scenario considered, and the color intensity indicates the scaling factor.", "metadata": {}}}
