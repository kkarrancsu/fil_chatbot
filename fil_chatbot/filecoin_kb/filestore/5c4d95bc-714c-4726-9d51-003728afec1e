With its introduction, users can enjoy more predictable gas fees and improved transaction inclusion reliability, while simultaneously mitigating some of the issues related to miner extractable value (MEV). Nonetheless, during periods of high demand, the problem of transaction congestion remains, which calls for a solution that can further optimize the process.\n\nThis is where the idea of a multi-dimensional EIP1559 mechanism (AKA 'gas lanes') comes into play. Gas lanes propose the segregation of transactions into different 'lanes' based on several criteria [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07919). This criteria could be, e.g., compute vs storage intensive messages [[3]](https://hackmd.io/IVCFQYo7T--v-xNxmhfv0w). An additional\ncriteria could be grouping messages by the types of user.", "metadata": {}}}
