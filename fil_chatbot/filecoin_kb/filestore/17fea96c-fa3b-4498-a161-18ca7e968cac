This means that canisters running on a subnet can seamlessly call canisters hosted in any other subnet of the Internet Computer blockchain.\n\n**Governance**\n\nAnother feature of the Internet Computer is that it runs under the control of a decentralized permissionless governance system, (Network Nervous System**;** NNS), which runs completely on-chain. The NNS can make decisions on (1) creating new subnet blockchains, (2) updating the node machines, and (3) configuring parameters used in the Internet Computer protocol. \n\nAnyone can participate in the governance and submit new proposals to the NNS or vote on open proposals. To do so, users have to stake ICP, the Internet Computer utility tokens, and create a\u00a0**neuron**\u00a0with the NNS.\n\n**Example Applications**", "metadata": {}}}
