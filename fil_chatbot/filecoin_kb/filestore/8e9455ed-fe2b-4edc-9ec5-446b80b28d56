We reiterate that by doing this, we take into account several combinations of demand profiles.\n\n\nNotice that we chose to have a a distribution for $B'$ that concentrates around smaller values that the one of $B$ since intuitively, SPs would tend to have a more inelastic demand function; indeed, they need to consistently submit proofs of storage on time, which allows for less flexibility on whether they can choose to submit a message or not. \n\n**No preference**", "metadata": {}}}
