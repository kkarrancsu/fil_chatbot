Divide the block into 2 lanes; one for maintenance and onboarding messages (M&O) and one for everything else. \n2. Assign each *Instruction/OpCode* to either one of those lanes\n3. Endow each lane with its own transaction fee mechanism and\n4. Give the whole system a *lane adjustment mechanism*, which at each epoch assigns an amount of target block size to each epoch according to a well-defined rule.\n\nWe now discuss our proposed mechanism in more detail.\n\n## 2.2 Components\n\n### 2.2.1 Choice of lane.\n\nWe Propose to allocate the following messages into their own lane (lane $\\ell=1$)\n`SubmitWindowedPoSt`, `PreCommitSector`, `ProveCommitSector`,`proveCommitAggregate`, `precommitSectorBatch`. We will denote these messages as *Maintenance and Onboarding* (M&O).\n\nAll other messages and opcodes will be allocated to lane $\\ell=2$.", "metadata": {}}}
