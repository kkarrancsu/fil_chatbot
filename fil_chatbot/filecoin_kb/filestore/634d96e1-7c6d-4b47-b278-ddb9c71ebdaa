With Solution 1, all the extra quality power will act at the beginning of the sector lifetime, where the reward per sector is generally higher, if we assume that total new rewards decrease over time, and total network QAP increases over time. The amount of reward a FIL+ deal will earn depends on when along the sector lifetime it is located. In Contrast with Solution 2, one effectively obtains the time average reward, for placing the anywhere in the sector lifetime.", "metadata": {}}}
