Initially, we propose to set $L=2$, one lane for M&O (lane 1) and the other for everything else (lane 2). The number of lanes can be reevaluated in a posterior FIP as the conditions of the network change. \n\n**Initial lane width** For Lane 1, this parameter can be estimated by computing the average gas used by M&O messages and potentially inflating this quantity by some small factor as a way of providing some *wiggle room* and potentially avoiding introducing shocks to the cost, ultimately, the goal is to guarantee that such a *priority* lane is equipped with sufficient gas so that these transactions can get included on-chain without users having to pay unprofitable fees for them.", "metadata": {}}}
