Larger values (increased from 30% currently) can\u00a0 impact\u00a0 immediate returns. This must be balanced against a positive change to percentage value locked. We therefore suggest 40 or 50% are attractive Initial Consensus Pledge targets that the community should consider.\n\nWith the introduction of a duration multiplier, SPs experience a change in incentives. In annualized percentage return terms, the new incentives are better aligned with the long-term useful data network goals. For example, sectors with FIL+ deals continue to generate better returns than Committed Capacity sectors, and longer sectors generate higher returns than shorter sectors (Fig. 4B).", "metadata": {}}}
