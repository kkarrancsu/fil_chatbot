This may seem to be lead to a phenomenon where nodes state the minimum requirements in order to pay less collateral. However, this is a double-edged sword because we can always compare the reported metrics with the actual services being delivered. If an operator reports a 10Gbps upload speed, we can flag the operator when they suddenly serve 12 Gbps. On the other hand, if an operator overpromises, they will have to pay a higher collateral while seeing their rewards adjust to actual performance delivered.", "metadata": {}}}
