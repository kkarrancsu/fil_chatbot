Sweeping across pessimistic, median, and optimistic scenario for storage onboarding at various levels of shortfall updake, we find that both shortfall policies could result in higher rates of onboarding and net lower circulating supply. The Thing 2 variant would likely create more permanent deflationary pressure due to burning a greater share of block rewards to pay back shortfall, but over the long-term, token locking and decreasing initial pledges will largely directionally determine circulating supply dynamics. \n\nCryptoEconLab will look to provide the community with further analysis and insight on the incentive spaces relevant to the shortfall policies as the public discussion on shortfall policy continues to evolve, and further points are raised by the community.", "metadata": {}}}
