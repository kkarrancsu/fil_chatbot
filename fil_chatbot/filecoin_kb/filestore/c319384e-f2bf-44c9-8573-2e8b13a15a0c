If the new pledge at the time of the expiration is lower than the original pledge, the sector's pledge will not be released. However, if the new pledge is higher than the original, then the sector's pledge is released and the new higher pledge will get locked.\n\nThis means that for renewed sectors, the new pledge will always be greater or equal to the original pledge, which makes the equations for $\\Delta pledgeL(t)$ different depending on whether they are coming from onboards or renewals:\n\n$$\\Delta PledgeL(t) = \\Delta oPledgeL(t) + \\Delta rPledgeL(t)$$\n\n$$\\Delta oPledgeL(t) = oPl_t$$\n\n$$\\Delta rePledgeL(t) = rePl_t - releasePl_t$$\n\n\nNote that the delta pledge for new oboards doesn't have releases. Pledge is only locked from storage collateral and consensus collateral during onboarding. The formulas are:\n\n$$oPl_t = oStoragePl_t + oConsensusPl_t$$\n\n$$oStoragePl_t = 20 \\cdot dayRe_t \\cdot \\frac{O_t^{QA}}{P_t^{QA}}$$", "metadata": {}}}
