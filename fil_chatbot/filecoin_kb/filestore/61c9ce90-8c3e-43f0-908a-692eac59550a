For example, we can take inspiration from Polkadot\u2019s parachain auction, trying to price the subnet to the groups/operators/teams that can derive the most value from it (bidding) and give the access to them.\n            - Similarly, we may not need to enable sub subnet from the get go.\n- Given that there is a policy for spawning a chain, who gets to decide when to sunset one? It is unclear who should have that power and under what conditions. We should go back to first principles.\n    - A possible way out is the \u201cstable coin\u201d model above, where subnet members can cash out a piece of the parent token supply, by burning their subnet token . A subnet naturally dies out, or more accurately stops interacting with the parent net, when all of its parent-net tokens are removed.\n    \n### TODO", "metadata": {}}}
