This in turn could lead to a more efficient allocation of resources and better handling of congestion. However, increasing the number of lanes can also result in added complexity for both miners and users, making it more challenging to determine the optimal lane for a transaction or to adjust lane parameters effectively. Therefore, when choosing the number of lanes, it is essential to strike a balance between granularity and simplicity to maintain efficient network operation.", "metadata": {}}}
