Some notes: this requires paying any difference in pledge, and gaining a SDM in the QAP calculation (later). Practical note: in reality re-onboarding is machine-limited by resealing throughput. In addition to the terminations being re-onboarded, the scheduled expirations and renewals vectors have to change to account for dropped power (what's gone doesn't scheduled expire or renew --- and when reintroduced, these things get pushed to future). \n* Post termination event, onboarding continues as before, renewals and onboards continue with the updated vectors.\n\nNow we can describe each term in the power.\n\nFirstly, for onboarding $O_{t}^{\\text{RB}}$, no change.", "metadata": {}}}
