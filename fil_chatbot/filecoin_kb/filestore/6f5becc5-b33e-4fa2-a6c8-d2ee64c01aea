Concretly, we expect the circulating supply to grow from 339M to 639M, depending on the scenario. This is the result of the accelerated vesting from Ecosystem Fund and the new token allocations that vest immediatly. \n- From here, circulating supply stabilizes and continues to grow for the following 2 years. Supply growth rates decelerate significantly in all scenarios at the start of 2026. This is the time when legacy vesting schedules finish.\n- In all scenarios, daily inflation rates are lower than 0.9%, which is below the 1.5% currently experienced by the network.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJrBCt5F3.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BksDk5cKn.png\">\n\n**Figure 3.1:** Circulating supply and inflation rate by combined scenario\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
