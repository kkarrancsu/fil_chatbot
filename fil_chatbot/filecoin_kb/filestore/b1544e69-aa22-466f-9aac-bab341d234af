The generalised order flow for such solutions are:\n1. Users encrypt their transactions and send it to the mempool for execution\n2. Block producers commit to a particular flow and make this commitment public \n3. The transactions are then decrypted and executed in the order that the block builder committed to", "metadata": {}}}
