It is not clear how this works in the CoD model because only the client knows what the computations are going to be.  Self-validation may be a good model in this case.  Data scientists usually do extensive checking on the results (and often discover their own errors).  In the case of satellite image processing and cloud removal (a use case for Bacalhau), the results are obvious to the client. \n\n### **Scheduler/match-maker**\n\nThe scheduler is part of the Filecoin network presumably and is a necessary part of the workflow.  Some applications may require heavy GPU processing while other applications can be run on CPUs.  It is not yet clear how the match making process will occur.  Value flows to the client and the compute provider if the scheduler does an efficient job at aligning needs with compute resources.\n\n### **Filecoin Netowrk**", "metadata": {}}}
