The canister can communicate with other canisters in a asynchronous fashion; (3) it can spawn new canisters and (4) canisters have bidirectional communications\u2014so they can send requests and receive responses.\n\nEach canister is replicated over all nodes in the subnet.  Browsers and API calls can operate directly on canisters.  A canister cannot modify its balance of tokens.  Canisters can reference secure randomness through the Random Beacon Layer.  DApp users can interact with canisters without holding tokens.  \n\nCanisters do not crash\u2014instead they roll back to the state before the crash.  A canister controlling another canister is a key capability of the ICP.  \n\n**Cycles**", "metadata": {}}}
