At the policy change date, we test three onboarding levels of RBP, at 5 PiB/day, 10 PiB/day, and 15 PiB/day, and set the renewal rate to 50%. Since the renewal rate fluctuates, this is a middle ground that captures the \u201caverage\u201d case of the network. We set the FIL+ rate to 100% to observe the effect of the various multiplier schedules and note that this is very close to current onboarding trends where the FIL+ rate is greater than 90%.", "metadata": {}}}
