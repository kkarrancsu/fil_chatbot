The multiplier does not depend on size of storage provider or quantity of raw byte.\n\nA concern raised is that capital availability may unfairly advantage larger SPs. We don\u2019t necessarily agree with this, because complexity of operations increases quickly with size. The cost of acquiring collateral increases approximately sublinearly. This should benefit small SPs.\n\nNote that the ROI calculations above show rewards relative to gas and initial pledges. When also factoring in CapEx and OpEx costs, there should be minimal disadvantage to SP\u2019s based on size. Conservatively, CapEx and OpEx, costs scale roughly linearly, so, at worst, smaller miners remain on the same playing field as larger players. At best, however, they are able to take advantage of existing FIL+ incentives, the relative ease of obtaining collateral, coupled with more efficient/cheaper operations, in order to quickly boost their return profiles.", "metadata": {}}}
