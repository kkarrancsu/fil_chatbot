When compared to FIL+ SPs, CC SPs have lower bandwidth costs (due to not needing retrieval of data), lower costs associated with borrowing pledge per TiB of capacity onboarded, no business development and data preparation costs. However, CC miners also receive a smaller share of block rewards.\n2. **FIL+** - This models an SP trying to grow a data storage business, utilizing the FIL+ program. When compared to CC SPs, FIL+ SPs have higher bandwidth costs (due to retrievals), higher storage costs (due to needing to store redundant copies of the data), a non-zero business development cost, and higher pledge collateral costs. However, FIL+ SPs receive more block rewards than CC SPs, and can potentially also receive deal income from storing clients data.", "metadata": {}}}
