For a given new inflow of funding to the reward pool, we need to define how the total funding will be split daily to pay rewards. Blockchains such as Bitcoin use an exponential decay model, where mining rewards get exponentially smaller with time. This model benefits early adopters so that the network achieves a faster growth at the start. Another option is to split the total funding equally throughout the duration of the client agreement, which would be the simplest approach. Another approach is to tie the reward distribution to the network's growth (e.g. the total bandwidth provided by the network). This design has the advantage of aligning incentives with growth since operators will want to collectively growth the network to extract bigger rewards. It also reduces the impact of larger rewards for early adopters and makes rewards more or less constant through time. This question is further **discussed in the simulation", "metadata": {}}}
