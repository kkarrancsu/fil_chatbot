Then within a few months it will become lower than the current pledge. How quickly it becomes lower depends on how quickly the average duration changes, which depends on how quickly storage providers adopt longer durations and the new distribution of sector durations that we see. The trajectories for a range of scenarios are shown here:\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"300\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJVeQzq_i.png\">\n<br>\n<br>\n</div>\n\nNote, despite pledge decreasing with time, we do not expect any incentive misalignment. The protocol structure is intended to mean ROI will work for storage providers sealing sectors immediately, and for new storage providers joining in the future.\n\n### What will the % of available locked supply be?\n\nSimulations indicate the percentage of available supply that is locked will increase if the FIP is accepted.", "metadata": {}}}
