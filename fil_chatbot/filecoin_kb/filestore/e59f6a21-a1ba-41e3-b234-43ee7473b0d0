As an example, a 1-year sector that is renewing for an additional year would get a 2-year duration multiplier after renewal.\n\nThis new approach is expected to have two main benefits:\n\n1. We can maintain the current upper limit of 1.5 years for the sector duration. This was a security concern raised by Nicola.\n2. We expect this mechanism to smooth out the amount of circulating supply being locked and the drop in SPs profitability.", "metadata": {}}}
