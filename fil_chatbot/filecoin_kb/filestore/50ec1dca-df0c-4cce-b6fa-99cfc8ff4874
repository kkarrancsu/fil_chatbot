Notice that, depending on the design choice regarding the flexibility discussed above, this can be understood as adjusting $B^*_\\ell$ (the target), $B_\\ell$ (the maximum lane size), or both, however, for the sake of exposition, we will limit ourselves to the case where $B^*_\\ell$ is updated. Define the *relative priority factor* of lane $\\ell$ at epoch $t$ as $p_{\\ell,t}\\in(0,1)$, where $\\sum_\\ell p_{\\ell,t}=1$ for any epoch $t$. At epoch $t+1$, the $\\ell$-th lane is assigned a target width $B^*_{\\ell,t+1}$ given by\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nB^*_{\\ell,t+1}:=p_{\\ell,t+1}B^*, \\quad \\text{where, currently, $B^*=\\frac{B}{2}$}.\n\\end{aligned}\nThe relative priority of lane $\\ell$ then gets adjusted on an epoch-to-epoch basis according to some updating mechainsm $H_\\ell$, i.e., \n\n\\begin{aligned}\np_{\\ell,t+1}&:=H_\\ell(p_{\\ell,t}, X_t).\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\nWe now discuss several possible choices of $H_\\ell$.\n\n**Example mechanism: Fixed**", "metadata": {}}}
