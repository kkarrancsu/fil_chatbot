It helps code and data loaded inside it to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. TEEs can be used to encrypt mempools by moving block production logic into a TEE.  Transactions can be decrypted using a decryption key that is stored in the TEE before they are executed and bundled into a block. This is appealing because it doesn't require changes to the underlying blockchain protocol, doesn't compromise composability on smart-contract chains, and doesn't incur any settlement delay. However, TEEs also have drawbacks, such as the security model, which requires trust in entities like Intel. Additionally, there is a lack of control at a protocol level in case of breaches in the TEE. Such cases would warrent hardware manufactures to rollout a patch for their firmware.", "metadata": {}}}
