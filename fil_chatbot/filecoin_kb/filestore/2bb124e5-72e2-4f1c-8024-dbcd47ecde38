Concretly, higher network usage and lower token prices will lead to higher APRs for the same TVL rate, which is exactly as intended! By converting part of the services fees collected to QRDO and locking them in the Ecosystem fund, we create this balancing effect where:\n\n- More usage leads to more service fees, which leads to more tokens locked in the Ecosystem Fund.\n- Lower token prices lead to higher conversion rates, which also leads to more tokens locked in the Ecosystem fund.\n\nIn turn, more tokens locked in the Ecosystem fund have a double effect on the TVL rate and APR:\n\n- On APR, we have more rewards available to distribute.\n- On the TVL rate, we have a lower circulating supply, which increases the TVL rate. Recall that TVL rate = TVL divided by circulating supply.", "metadata": {}}}
