Furthermore, it follows from its definition that $S$ is a diffeomorphism; which in turn implies that $F$ has a probability $f$*.\n\n\n**Modeling SP's demand**\n\n\nLet $\\hat{G}_\\text{sp}$ denote the demand (in gas units) for a basefes $b=b_{\\text{min}}$, and denote by $S_\\text{sp}(p)$ the survival function of SPs.  Then, we can define the **SP-driven demand, $D_\\text{sp}(p)$,** as a function of the price as", "metadata": {}}}
