You would adjust this parameter while keeping the staking renewal rate constant and look at the resulting changes in circulating supply. For example, if increasing the protocol funded rate from 10% to 20% results in a decrease of the circulating supply from 1000 tokens to 900 tokens, then the marginal dependence of circulating supply on protocol funded rate is negative in this case.", "metadata": {}}}
