The following two methods aim at alleviating this issue. \n\n#### 5.3.2 As a joint process.\n\nAs it can be seen from the correlation plot of Section 4.2, only the top 3 messages, namely `ProveCommitSector` `PreCommitSector` and `SubmitWindowedPoSt ` have non-negligible correlation. To capture this, one could fit a 3-dimensional KDE to the normalized gas usage data from these three messages. Denoting the joint probability distribution of these three messages by $F^\\text{top}$, one can then repeat the procedure above by sampling $$(\\tilde{G}_t^\\text{ProveCommitSector},\\tilde{G}_t^\\text{PreCommitSector},\\tilde{G}_t^\\text{SubmitWindowedPoSt})\\sim F^\\text{top},$$ and all the other less impactful variables independently of each other.", "metadata": {}}}
