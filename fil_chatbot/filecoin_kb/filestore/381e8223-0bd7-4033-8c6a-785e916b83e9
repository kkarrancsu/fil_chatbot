This is normal, as this parameter, again, controls how much of the ecosystem fund is given  to validators. \n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryZccdZK2.png)\n\n\nSimilarly, as before, the vesting decay rate significantly impacts the validator rewards for small values of the parameter at hand' and has no impact for larger values. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkR6azs_n.png)\n\nA zoomed-in version is shown below. As we can see, the effect is far more significant at smaller scales.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1kjq_WY3.png)", "metadata": {}}}
