This is intuitive since, were it not the case, dishonest nodes would always gain some money because no detection system will catch all the fake logs. However, this creates a problem in a situation where collateral is not required - if a node is flagged, and it is assigned a negative reward, where is that money coming from?\n\nA possible solution is to introduce some delay to rewards. When a node submits logs, a reward is computed and stored for some time. If, in the meantime, that nodes gets assigned a penalty, it will be deducted from the stored rewards. Finally, the rewards that \"vest\" at each day will be sent to the node, minus the penalties applied. Therefore, at each point in time, all nodes have money \"at stake\" that can be slashed to cover for penalties.", "metadata": {}}}
