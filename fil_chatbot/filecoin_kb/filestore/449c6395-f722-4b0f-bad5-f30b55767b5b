Thus, these economies depend heavily on exports and foreign investment for sustainability and growth.\n* **Currency risk.** Many islands have their native currency. These native currencies can be exchanged with other currencies or fiat money. The exchange rate plays a crucial role in determining the purchasing power of the native currency, and strong exchange rates are essential for acquiring resources from external economies. This currency risk is enhanced by the economy's reliance on foreign trading.", "metadata": {}}}
