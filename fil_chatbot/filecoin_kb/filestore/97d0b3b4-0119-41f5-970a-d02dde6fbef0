The flipside is increased potential to incentivise early termination to re-onboard in specific scenarios.\n* In general a rush of terminations to re-onboard, which could happen in the \u2018new sectors only\u2019 case, should be mitigated by a number of factors. But in supply terms, because this would drop QAP and increase circulating supply, pushing up Initial Pledge for future re-onboarding.\n* Incentives to terminate can occur for individual sector choices  under specific network conditions in both \u2018all sectors\u2019 or \u2018new sectors\u2019 cases. In scenarios with high QAP growth, there is more potential for short duration sectors to terminate-to-re-onboard.
