In this report, we provide an introduction to the problem and solutions space, discuss the competitor landscape, and go deeper into the mechanisms they use and how they can be improved upon. \n\n:::warning\n:question: **Open questions:**\n- What stage of development is the L2 architecture at currently? Would it follow a process flow as charted out in the doc (validation)\n- Would the TLE for the L2 be provided by the same nodes that generate randomness for the VRF network? If so, how would the coordination (specifically for maintaining synchrony for both applications simultaneously) work?\n- What mechanism would we need to focus on? (Rollup vs Drand node operator incentives)\n:::\n\n## Intro", "metadata": {}}}
