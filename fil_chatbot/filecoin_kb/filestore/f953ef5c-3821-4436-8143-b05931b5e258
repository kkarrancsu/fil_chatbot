However, since this FIP is intended to be implemented in a secenario where FEVM-related messages are in such a high demand that they might imply a threat to network critical messages, that increase in use on the other lane should, at least in theory, alleviate thar reduction on protocol revenue. It is also important to mention that this approach is NOT optimal, but is is easy to implement. \n\n\n\n**Why enforcing lower and upper bounds on the target block size *given* to M&O?**\n\nRecall that each lane has its own EIP1559-like transaction fee mechanism of the form \n\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_{\\ell,t+1}&=b_{\\ell,t}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{8}\\frac{G_{\\ell,t}- B^*_{\\ell,t}}{B^*_{\\ell,t}}\\right).\n\\end{aligned}", "metadata": {}}}
