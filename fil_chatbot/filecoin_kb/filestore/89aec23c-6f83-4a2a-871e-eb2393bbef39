There are two main ways of generating randomness (or random numbers). The first one, is via physical devises that exploit some physical law known to include some *mathematical randomness in it* (e.g., radioactive decay), which, to my understanding, are widely unpractical (or at least expensive) or by using [*Pseudo-Random Numbers*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator), which are generated by a computer, utilizing some algorithm. Since these numbers are the product of a function, they are not strictly speaking \"random\" (since for a given seed you can recreate the sequence of numbers), however, Random Number Generating (RNG) algorithms typically produce streams of random numbers that satisfy tests (see e.g., [Nist SP 800-22](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/22/r1/upd1/final) )that bona-fide random numbers would (statistical independence, etc). This is what happens under the hood when you use `numpy.random.random()` in Python, for example (via the", "metadata": {}}}
