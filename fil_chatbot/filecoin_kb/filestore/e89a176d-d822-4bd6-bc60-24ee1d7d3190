The tipping rate is the percentage of fees paid by these clients to the LCC that will be \"tipped\" to the network. As Qredo's LLC is responsible for business development, client relations, and payment collection for these clients, they cannot pay the entirety of the fees back to the network. On the other hand, the clients are using the decentralized protocol and thus some value must be transferred. This split is encoded by the tipping rate.\n\n**The tipping rate and the QRDO discount rate will be defined in the second phase of this project**.\n\n:::warning\n:warning: **Discuss with the team:** fiat-to-QRDO conversion strategy (question are above)  \n:::\n\n### How are fees computed?\n\nCurrently, fees are computed as a rate applied to the total volume in USD traded by the user in billable transactions.", "metadata": {}}}
