This is done since we are using a Monte Carlo method, which means that we sample multiple trajectories for each market input, run MechaQredo on each of these trajectories, and then estimate the average output response, as well as its standard deviation.\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkIFiYCqh.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJUtjzaFn.png\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJ8_jfaKh.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkhuoGaF2.png\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1gyafat2.png\">\n    \n**Figure 2.1:** Market inputs by scenario. *Note: validator counts does not depent on the scenarios!*\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
