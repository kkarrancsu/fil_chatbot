Thus, Saturn's log detection module aims to solve this problem by finding and flagging doctored or fake logs submitted by node operators.\n\nThere are also attack vectors on the side of the orchestrator and the client websites. For instance, client websites can lie about the requests being served to reduce how much they are paying for Saturn's service, while node operators can \"fake\" their perceived performance to the orchestrator by answering to the orchestrator differently from real users. However, these attack vectors are not the major concern for the first version of Saturn and, therefore, they will be addressed in later versions.\n\n## Design overview\n\nWhen we talk about suspicious behavior, there are two separate levels at which we can detect it:", "metadata": {}}}
