We are free to mathematically *let $\\varepsilon$ go to zero*, but in reality $\\varepsilon$ doesn't really *go* anywhere, it is a constant set at 30s. So this is not the actual limit that describes reality. In reality what we mean by *continuous* limit, is that we are looking at time scales that are too long, to care about the local epoch to epoch dynamics.", "metadata": {}}}
