Correspondingly, the agents can also modulate their renewal rates of existing sectors between 20% and 80%. 80% of Mixed SPs modeled sectors are FIL+ with the same onboarding and renewal bounds. \nFig 1, 2, and 3 show the optimistic, status quo, and pessimistic scenarios when agents leave the network gradually. Fig 4, 5, and 6 show the same onboarding scenarios when agents suddenly leave/terminate from the network.  \n\n\n### General Trends\nWe observe several features across all scenarios:", "metadata": {}}}
