We can take the scheduled expirations coming from known active sectors directly from the network. This is the $\\textrm{rb_known_scheduled_expire_vec}$ provided as input.  \n\n\n## Quality-adjusted power\n\nThe equations for QA power are almost the same as the ones for RB power, where one can simply exchange the $RB$ by $QA$. There are however three differences.\n\nFirstly, the new onboarded power needs to be adapted to take into account the duration multiplier for 1-year sectors and the rate of FIL+ deals (where $\\gamma = \\textrm{fil_plus_rate}$):", "metadata": {}}}
