The goal is to have tangible outcomes that demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits of the EIP 1559 mechanism combined with gas lanes. Ultimately, a proof of concept of how gas lanes work and how it can be used to mitigate increasing gas costs in some blockchains would be ideal. Here are some suggested deliverables, that we expect to adjust once a team has been created.\n\n1. **Conceptual Design and Documentation:**\n\n    Students will need to thoroughly understand the EIP 1559 mechanism and the concept of gas lanes, and come up with a design that integrates both effectively. This will include creating flowcharts, network diagrams, or pseudocode as required. They should also compile comprehensive documentation that details the proposed system's design and potential impacts on the Ethereum ecosystem.", "metadata": {}}}
