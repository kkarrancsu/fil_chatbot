FSS uses decentralized oracle networks to collect user transactions off-chain, generate decentralized consensus for transaction ordering, and submit the ordered transactions using the Arbitrum protocol. In the first phase of FSS, user transactions are encrypted to hide transaction details, ordered by a decentralized oracle network, and then decrypted for execution by the Arbitrum protocol. This will remove the ability to front-run transactions based on early visibility. In the second phase of FSS, Aequitas ordering (consensus) protocols will be implemented to order transactions based on supermajority receive time. This will help enforce a first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering policy, and will be combined with transaction encryption mechanism from phase one, to provide a more defense-in-depth solution for the fair ordering of user transactions.", "metadata": {}}}
