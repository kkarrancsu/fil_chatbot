We remark, however, that these are ***a Priori* solutions** and that they have yet to be tested extensively in a robust simulation environment. Once we have a running simulation environment, we can fine-tune these proposed solutions and envision other possible solutions. \n\n### Short term\n\n#### Gas lanes. \n\nA first approach would be to consider so-called gas lanes. In this setting, one assigns a fixed proportion of the block space to several classes of messages. We describe the main idea behind this setting below. \n\nThe first step is to classify the types of messages in $N_c$ different categories based on, e.g., their perceived importance or purpose. As discussed in  Appendix A1, these categories could be, for example:", "metadata": {}}}
