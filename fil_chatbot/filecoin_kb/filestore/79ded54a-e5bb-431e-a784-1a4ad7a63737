Filecoin\n**Remark.** *Notice that since we are taking a 1:1 equivalence between Ethereum and Polygon, the following approximations also hold for the equivalence between gas in Filecoin-Polygon.*\n\nComparing gas usage between two networks is complex, as such an amount can depend on several factors. However, as a first approximation, we extend the \"back-of-the-envelope\" computation presented [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm/issues/1401), in the hopes that it can be helpful.", "metadata": {}}}
