This is not currently possible with the current design, where we use a centralized fraud detection system to flag operators.\n\nHaving this in mind, in this section we detail a simplified collateral mechanism that focus on solving a smaller scope, while only slashing behaviors that can be verified. With this simpler mechanism, we target the following goals:\n\n* Increase the cost of takeover attacks where a single operator floods the network with a huge number of nodes feeding from the same hardware resources.\n* Increase the commitment of node operators to the Saturn network.", "metadata": {}}}
