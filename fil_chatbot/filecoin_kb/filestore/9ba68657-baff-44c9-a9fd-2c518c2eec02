This is to avoid introducing additional sources of complexity, since a larger number of lanes, would in turn imply that the end user needs to track a larger number of base fees, etc. \n\nFurthermore, we propose to only include these 5 messages sinc e they can be reasonably well predicted by raaw byte power, as disacussed in section 2.2.3.\n\n\n\n### 2.2.2 Inclusion mechanism.", "metadata": {}}}
