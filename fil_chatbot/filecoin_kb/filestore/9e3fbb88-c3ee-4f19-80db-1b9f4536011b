Such a FIP proposes several code optimizations as well as technical changes that ultimately affect how gas is accounted for. While gas accounting and usage would, in general, pose economic risks or blockers, \n**we did not detect any major economic concerns or risks** associated with this FIP with its current choice of parameters.\n\nAs with all FIPs that could have any economic impact, however, we believe it is worth it actively monitor gas usage after implementation, especially given the wider context of this FIP (namely FVM).", "metadata": {}}}
