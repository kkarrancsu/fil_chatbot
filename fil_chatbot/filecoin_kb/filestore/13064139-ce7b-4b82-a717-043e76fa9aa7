The reader uninterested with these mathematical details can freely skip the next section.\n\n## Model\n\n\n\nWe begin with some definitions. For any epoch $t$, let $R_t\\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq0}$ denote the block reward at an epoch $t$, let $G_t\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ denote the gas usage, and let $b_t\\in[b_\\text{min},\\infty)$ denote the base fee. Furthermore, for any given SP $m$, let $\\rho_m$ denote that SP relative power in the network.   \n\n**Definition (expected cashflow)**. For a given value of $b_t$, we define the *expected cashflow* of miner $m$ at epoch $t$ as \n\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Phi(m,t,b_t):=\\mathbb{E}_m[R_t]-b_t\\mathbb{E}_m[G_t]-O_m,\n\\end{aligned}\nwhere $O_m$ represents the *op-ex* of miner $m$. Here, $\\mathbb{E}_m[\\cdot]$ represents the expectation over the probability measure induced by the lottery process for which  SP $m$ gets to mine a block.", "metadata": {}}}
