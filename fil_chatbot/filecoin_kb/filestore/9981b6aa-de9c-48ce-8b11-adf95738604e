That ratio is based on the quality-adjusted power of the sector and the network's total quality-adjusted power:\n\n$$R_{\\Sigma} = \\sum_{t = 1}^{d_e} R_t \\cdot \\frac{sectorQAP}{P_t^{QA}} = m \\cdot s \\cdot \\sum_{t = 1}^{d_e} \\frac{R_t }{\\mathcal{M}_t \\cdot P_t^{RB}} $$\n\nWe can see that the total rewards are influenced by the proportion of QA power secured by the network at the time of sealing and the subsequence QA power of the network. If the network's Qa power increases (which is expected), the rewards will decrease at each new epoch.\n\n#### Sector initial pledge\n\nThe initial pledge of a sector is the composed of a storage collateral and a consensus collateral. Both collaterals are computed when sector is selead (i.e., $t=0$):\n\n$$Pl_0 = StoragePl_0 + ConsensusPl_0$$", "metadata": {}}}
