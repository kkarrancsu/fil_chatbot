An interesting feature is that the ACF plot does not seem to decay very fast, meaning that there might be some hidden correlation among messages of this kind across blocks.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/J4Sgyha.png)\n\n\nLastly, `PreCommitSectorBatch` and `DeclareFaultsRecovered` are other types of message that gets sent fairly often. Notice that the range of their gas consumption is about one order of magnitude smaller than the one for the previous messages.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yIyCXPn.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FmmaJGX.png)", "metadata": {}}}
