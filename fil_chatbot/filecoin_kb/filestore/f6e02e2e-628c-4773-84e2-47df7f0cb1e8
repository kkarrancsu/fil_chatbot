The plot on the bottom left shows the AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) of $\\tilde{G}_t$. From such a plot one can measure the dependence of $\\tilde{G}_t$ (and hence $G_t$, as it is just an affine transformation) on its history, with the rough interpretation that the first zero of the ACF is roughly how long it takes the process $\\tilde{G}_t$ to \"forget\" (i.e., become independent of) its history. In our case, we can see that the ACF plot crosses 0 at around lag-5, meaning that, roughly, two realizations of the gas process become independent of each other every five-or-so blocks.", "metadata": {}}}
