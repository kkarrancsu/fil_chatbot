Then main aim of a CDN is to serve content to users and, as such, the total amount of data (measured in bytes) delivered by Saturn in a given time interval should be as high as possible.\n\nIn addition, high bandwidth is expensive to maintain, which means it needs to be properly incentivized. As such, we aim to make bandwidth the metric with the most influence in rewards. \n\nWe can collect the total data serve for each request from the transfer logs, and we can aggregate it by node to get the total bandwidth served by the node in a give time interval.\n\n**Performance**\n\nThe second most important behavior we want to incentivize is performance. By this we mean the nodes should fulfill requests in such a way that leads to a good experience for clients. With this in mind, the two most important metrics are:", "metadata": {}}}
