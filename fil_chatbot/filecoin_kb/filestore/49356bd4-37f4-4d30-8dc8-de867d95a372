For context, the base scenario represents a situation where adoption and usage evolves acording to current trends and token price remains at the current values (i.e. token price with a constant trend at its current price, network usage consistent with the current status plus some mild growth assumptions, and a stable TVL). Then, the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios create worse and better versions of the base scenario, respectively.\n\nSince each dimension is assumed to be independent, we consider all possible scenario combinations across the 3 dimensions, which leads to 27 possible scenarios.", "metadata": {}}}
