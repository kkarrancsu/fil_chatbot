This is, in general not an easy task to do without any further assumptions on the dynamics of the process (such as assuming it is an AR(1) process, for example). We propose the following heuristic methodology. First, we discretize the interval $[-1,1]$ in $N_h$ non-overlapping subintervals $I_i$ of length $h=1/N_h$. Then, for each $\\tilde{G}_t\\in I_i$, we estimate the probability of moving to an interval $I_j$ $j\\in[1,\\dots,N_h]$, using the recorded data. This induces a Markov transition matrix $P_{ij}$, with the property that $\\sum_{j}P_{ij}=1$. The $i^\\text{th}$ row of this matrix can then be understood as the probability of moving from interval $i$ to interval $j$ in one step. Given this matrix, one can simulate the gas dynamics as follows", "metadata": {}}}
