For instance, we can remove flagged logs and give an additional penalty to the total reward of the operator after removing the fake logs. \n\nThe **penalty scope and the exact amount of each penalty will be an important component to test in the simulations**.\n\nAnother important consideration around penalties is whether they should only reduce future earnings or whether we should require collateral from nodes and apply penalties on the collateral as well. Having collateral has the advantage of requiring a higher commitment from node operators, while, at the same time, leveraging their loss aversion. On the other hand, collateral will have the disadvantage of increasing the entry barriers for node operators.", "metadata": {}}}
