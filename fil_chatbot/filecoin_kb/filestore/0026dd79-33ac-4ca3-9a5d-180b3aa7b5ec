This problem is NP-hard, which means finding an optimal solution can be computationally intensive. However, miners can employ heuristic or approximation algorithms to obtain near-optimal solutions within reasonable time frames. These algorithms can consider factors such as transaction fees, gas prices, and priorities to create a balanced and profitable block, however, it is unclear to us if this would represent a significant techincal challenge.", "metadata": {}}}
