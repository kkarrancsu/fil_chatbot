This is mainly due to the additional FIL locked to sustain higher storage onboarding rates. This lends credence to the argument that if a network shortfall policy were to help remove some onboarding frictions (namely collateral resourcing), a potentially beneficial short-term macroeconomic effect could be a substantial amount of FIL locked and removed from token supply. However, over the longer-term horizon (3+ years) we note the increasing trend in circulating supply. This is a result that holds true irrespective of either shortfall policy's effectiveness or the strength of storage onboarding. Therefore, either shortfall policy could potentially help stimulate a healthy rate of token inflow in the near-term, but neither shortfall policy can fully reverse the longer-term trend of", "metadata": {}}}
