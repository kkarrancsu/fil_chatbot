Rather than setting a maximum lane size on each lane, we  **only** introduce a *target gas usage* $B^*_{\\ell,t}$ on each lane, and messages can be included as long as there's available block space. Thus, denoting by $G_{\\ell,t}$ the amount of gas used in lane $\\ell$ at epoch $t$, the base fee $b_{\\ell,t}$ for such a lane evolves according to the rule:\n\n\n\\begin{aligned}\nb_{\\ell,t+1}&=b_{\\ell,t}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{8}\\frac{G_{\\ell,t}- B^*_{\\ell,t}}{B^*_{\\ell,t}}\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\nwhere $G_{\\ell,t}$ is allowed to take values between 0 and the maximum block size. We remark that the target block size, $B^*_{\\ell^*,t}$ is allowed to cahnge on an epoch-to-epoch basis, and this adjusting mechanism is described in the following section.", "metadata": {}}}
