Indeed, since that condition implies that $a_{\\ell,t}\\leq 1$, one has that\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{cost}_\\text{aml}(m)&=b_t\\left(\\sum_{\\ell=1}^La_{\\ell,t} G_{\\ell,t}\\right)\\leq b_t\\left(\\sum_{\\ell=1}^LG_{\\ell,t}\\right)=\\text{cost}_\\text{single lane}(m).\n\\end{aligned}\nIt is relatively easy to see that the previous result becomes a strict inequality (i.e., strictly cheaper) *if at least one*  of the parameters $a_{\\ell,t}<1$. \n#### The isomorphism\n\nObserving the similarity in the cost equations in both models raises a question: *Are these two approaches equivalent?* As we shall see, this question can be answered positively under a specific adjustment mechanism $a_{\\ell,t}$.", "metadata": {}}}
