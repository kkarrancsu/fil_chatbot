All transactions executed in the Qredo network incur a fixed protocol fee. This protocol fee is burned, which reduces the circulating supply. Thus, as network usage grows, more tokens are burned and more supply is taken from the Qredo Economy. However, we should note that this mechanism has a fairly small impact when compared with the other two.\n- **Release function for the Ecosystem fund**. The release rate that controls how much of the current balance in the Ecosystem Fund is released to pay Validators and Stakers depends on both TVL and the number of validators. This allows the network to release a higher percentage of tokens from the Ecosystem fund with the growth of these two metrics.", "metadata": {}}}
