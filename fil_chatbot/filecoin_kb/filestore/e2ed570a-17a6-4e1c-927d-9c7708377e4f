We are guaranteed to have bounded rewards have bounded rewards since we cannot spend more that what is already in the pool.\n2. We allow for price discovery on the sellers' side. In particular, we are giving a certain budget each day, and we are asking node operators to decide how many resources they are willing to contribute for that budget. When the network reaches an equilibrium, we will be able to compute at what price node operators value their resources and how much we need to charge future clients.\n\nThe first consideration when defining the reward pool is whether it should be pre-defined or variable. In a pre-defined pool, the entire amount of rewards to be paid for a given time interval is defined at the start and won't change, independently of the status of the network. A common example is Bitcoin's minting model, where the total amount of rewards to be paid are defined in the protocol and are fully predictable.", "metadata": {}}}
