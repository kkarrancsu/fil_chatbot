Instead, Qredo offers a weekly staking event with a 5.05% APY reward for holding QRDO tokens within the Qredo Network. This *synthetic staking* (i.e., no need to lock tokens into a pool) is automatic and rewards are distributed every Monday. \n\nFurthermore, this staking occurs on a per-wallet basis, not per account, and users are allowed to  withdraw QRDO at any time. However, this means that they would forfeit any accrued rewards for the amount withdrawn. Similarly, transferring QRDO between wallets within the same account resets the staking and results in reduced rewards. See [here](https://qredo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5806237485585-Ongoing-Weekly-Staking-Events) for more details. \n\n\n## Qredo's production value\n<!---\n:::warning\n:warning: This analysis is based on incomplete transaction data (due to data availability issues).
