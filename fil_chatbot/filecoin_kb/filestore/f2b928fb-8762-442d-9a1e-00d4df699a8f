This occurs because the \"legacy\" vesting schedules (e.g. Team, Seed rounds, etc.) are the most significant component impacting daily changes in circulating supply.\n- Daily inflation rates decrease significantly once the legacy vesting schedules stop (end of 2025). After this date, inflation rates become mostly driven by network growth (usage and staking sentiment) and token price.\n- The supply inflation rates decrease with time. The pessimistic scenario is the one that experiences the steeper fall due to the fall in token price and the consequent increase in tokens locked in the Ecosystem fund. In this scenario, the network becomes deflationary after 3 years. In the other scenarios, inflation rates are close to zero.", "metadata": {}}}
