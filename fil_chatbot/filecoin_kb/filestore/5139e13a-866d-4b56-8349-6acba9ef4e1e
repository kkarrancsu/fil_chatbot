In addition to the primary outcomes of rewarding long-term commitment and supporting client demand, longer sectors lock collateral for longer. This means more total locked collateral at any given time. How this gradually plays out as an increase in percentage locked value dynamics is shown in Figure 3A. The simulated scenarios show that as incentives induce longer average durations, the percentage locked value increases to around 50% over time (conditional on the model assumptions listed in the appendix). This is a more sustainable level to support long-term storage.", "metadata": {}}}
