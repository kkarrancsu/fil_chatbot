Methodology and datasets\nIn this report, we will focus on two main aspects of gas consumption. We will first investigate gas consumption at an aggregate, per-block level; that is, the sum of gas consumption across all actors for a given block. We will then focus on gas consumption at the actor level, where we will investigate the individual behavior of each of the gas components, per height (tipset). In both cases, we will investigate the statistical properties of gas consumption with the ultimate goal of being able to model such processes.", "metadata": {}}}
