Fee burning is meant to reward every user in the network, by reducing the circulating supply, therefore providing a deflationary pressure and making other tokens more valuable.  The benefit that fee burning provides to a given miner depends on what is the circulating supply, and how many tokens does the miner hold. \n\nLet $S$ be the circulating supply, and $W_m$ be the amount of tokens held by miner $m$, (including their wealth of previously held tokens and their income for the current block via block reward and miner tips).", "metadata": {}}}
