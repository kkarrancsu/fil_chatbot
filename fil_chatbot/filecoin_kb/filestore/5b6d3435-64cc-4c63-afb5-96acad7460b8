There can be considerable back-and-forth in the checking of processes.  As an aside, a large percentage (>> 50%) of processes are terminated early or produce unusable results.  This back-and-forth can be improved by running and testing locally before committing to the Bacalhau network.  To improve the UX for clients, tools for examining results and terminating processes.  \n\nFinally, finding interesting data on the Filecoin Network can be a challenge.  Adoption of Bacalhau is strongly dependent on improving the public\u2019s ability to identify data on the network.  Kaggle is an excellent model for identifying available data sets.  Another suggestion is to provide Python accessible data sets.\n\n### **Clients**", "metadata": {}}}
