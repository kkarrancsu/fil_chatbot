With a overcollateralization rate of 0%, this means that the rightful amount of eFIL that user A should get for their collateral is 400 eFIL. The user has 2 option - (1) Burn 200 eFIL tokens, or (2) Increase the ETH collateral to 1.5 ETH. \n    - One strategy that user A can do is to swap 200 eFIL to 200 FIL tokens, and sell them for 0.5 ETH. \n    - They can then add the 0.5 ETH to their original collateral without having to burn any tokens and compromise on the amount of yield that they earn. \n    - They have thus made a profit of 0.5 ETH due to the price difference", "metadata": {}}}
