If the amount was smaller, the cost of leaving the network would be smaller than the cost of continuing on the network. \n\nPrevious analysis has indicated that the monthly costs of running a L1 node varies between 1000 USD and 3000 USD. If we assume a linear distribution of these costs throughout the month, if we pick the most pessimist costs (3000 USD), and if we take the price of FIL as 5 USD, we get the following formula for the minimum collateral in FIL:\n\n$C(d) = \\frac{600d}{30}$\n\nwhere $d$ is the number of days until the end of the time-commitment. For instance, if there are 15 days missing to the time commitment, the liable amount needs to be at least $\\frac{600 \\cdot 15}{30} = 300 \\text{ FIL}$.", "metadata": {}}}
