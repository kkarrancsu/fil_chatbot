Conversely, in the investment conservation regime, pledge shows a decreasing trend and eventually reaches the same levels as in the data conservation regime. The initial jump in pledge can be explained by focusing on the dashed and dotted black lines. The dashed line is the start of the simulation and the dotted line is when SDM is enabled. Between those time-periods network QAP decreases. This follows from the investment conservation hypothesis since RBP is dropping but SDM has not yet been enabled. Once SDM is enabled, the QAP recovers. These two regions are shown in the pledge trajectories, where the pledge initially increases due to the drop in network QAP but changes direction as soon as SDM is enabled.", "metadata": {}}}
