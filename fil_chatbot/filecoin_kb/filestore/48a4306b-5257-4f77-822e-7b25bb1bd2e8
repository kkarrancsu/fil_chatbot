Note, an important assumption is that QAP grows, through the network seeing an increase in average sector durations while maintaining renewal, expiration, FIL+ rate and raw byte onboarding trends similar to today. These assumptions are discussed further in the Assumption and Limitations section, and further scenarios are given in the Appendix and Notebooks.\n\nIn general the declines observed in Initial Pledges are more pronounced when QAP growth is faster and larger. This results in the \u2018all sectors CC-jump\u2019 and \u2018new sectors CC-jump\u2019 scenarios seeing the largest and fastest decreases.\n\nThe decrease in pledge could contribute to an incentive to delay onboarding. Based on estimates of ROI \u2014 see Figure 1H \u2014 this appears unlikely.", "metadata": {}}}
