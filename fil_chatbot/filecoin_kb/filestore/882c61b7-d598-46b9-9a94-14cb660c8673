This is trusted data since the service is operated centrally and the data is not reported by nodes.\n\n### Bad behaviors\n\nOn the other hand, the behaviors we want to avoid mostly revolve around abuse and fraud. Examples include:\n\n* Doctored logs - creating logs of retrievals that didn't happen or changing real logs to improve some variables such as the bytes sent and the request duration. Some examples of metrics nodes can lie about:\n  * How long requests took to finish\n  * Their TTFB metric\n  * Uptime and status. For instance, nodes responding to health checks from the orchestrator while in actuality being offline or in a state of degraded performance to real users.\n  * The number of requests they served\n  * Amount of bytes they served to clients\n* Fake retrievals - retrievals made by operators or other actors that do not correspond to real and lawful clients of the network.\n* Retrievals returning the wrong content", "metadata": {}}}
