In this setting, one lane $(\\ell=1)$ is used exclusively for what we call *Maintenance and Onboarding Messages (M&O)*, namely`provecommit_sector_gas_used`,\n       `precommit_sector_gas_used`, `provecommit_aggregate_gas_used`,\n       `precommit_sector_batch_gas_used,` and \n       `submit_windowed_post_gas_used`,  and the other lane ($\\ell=2$) is used for everything else. Since there is a clear linear relation between the total gas used by M&O messages and network RBP (figure below, on the left), we can use simple linear regression to model\n       \n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathsf{Total \\ daily \\ gas\\ used\\ M\\&O}_t=2632.09\\times \\mathsf{Network\\  RBP}_t-9609,\n\\end{aligned}\nwhere the equation above is given in terms of Billions of gas units.", "metadata": {}}}
