This suggests that there might be some sort of *scale-invariance* in the dynamics of $\\tilde{G}_t$. \n\n\n## 4. Gas by message\n\n### 4.1 Basic analysis\n\nWe now move into examining gas usage by actor/method/message. To that end, we compute the total gas usage for each actor at any given height. Furthermore, we  have  separated the messages into two categories: the first category includes the so-called *Control Plane* messages, namely:\n\n`CompactSectorNumbers`,`DeclareFaultsRecovered`,`DisputeWindowedPoSt`,`ExtendSectorExpiration`,`PreCommitSector`,`PreCommitSectorBatch`,`ProveCommitSector`,`ProveCommitAggregate`,`ReportConsensusFault`,`SubmitWindowedPoSt`, and`TerminateSectors`.\n\nThe second category includes all other messages. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/O7x5Qu5.png)\n\nand in logarithmic scale (for ease of comparison):", "metadata": {}}}
