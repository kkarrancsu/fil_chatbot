Then, define the FIL conserved case as the onboarding level increased by the percentage of gas-cost savings afforded by DDO.  Using SP cost information, we find that on average, the percentage of costs attributable to gas for onboarding sectors is 0.026% (Fig 3) of the total onboarding costs across a range of exchange rates considered under assumptions detailed [here](https://hackmd.io/gzftJx5eQDKhv4-UEubSgg?view=#When-Filecoin-Plus-works-and-when-it-doesn%E2%80%99t).\n\n\n![gas_cost_pct](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1G-m9SIa.png)\n\n*Fig 3: Gas cost percentage of total cost needed to onboard a sector, swept across multiple FIL exchange rates*", "metadata": {}}}
