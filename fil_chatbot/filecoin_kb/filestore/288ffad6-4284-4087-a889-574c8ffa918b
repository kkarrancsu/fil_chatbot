For instance, Ethereum uses a mix of the native currency models and the burn model in its gas fees mechanism. \n\n\n## Qredo protocol fees\n\n### How are fees collected?\n\nAs explained before, protocol fees serve two main roles, namely increasing the cost of spam attacks and subsidizing part of the costs of running the Qredo protocol. Thus, for this use-case, we propose to use the **Burn Model for Qredo's protocol fees**. \n\nFirstly, burning is the most effective mechanism for preventing spam attacks. If validators received the protocol fees, they wouldn't have costs for adding network requests. Instead, burning introduces a level-playing field for all users wanting to use Qredo's L2 as the net costs of submitting a request are the same, independently of whether the user is also a Validator.", "metadata": {}}}
