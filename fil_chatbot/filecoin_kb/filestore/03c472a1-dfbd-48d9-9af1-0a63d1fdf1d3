More realistically, such a number will depend on how much data a particular miner is willing to onboard. Smaller miners are likely to be affected the most. Unsurprisingly, the limiting base fee decreases as a function of onboarding.*\n\nLet us now consider the case where in addition to *just* sending `submitWindowedPoSts` messages; miners are also interested in onboarding a daily amount of data $\\mathcal{O}$. For the sake of exposition, we will first derive some results under the assumption below and then present some results that do not rely upon it. \n\n**Assumptions (on onboarding)**", "metadata": {}}}
