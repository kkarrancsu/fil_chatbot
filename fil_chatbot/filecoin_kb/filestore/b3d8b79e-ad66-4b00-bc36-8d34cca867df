Fig 4\nshows the network KPIs to compare the effect of the transition period.  We observe that both the power and locking trajectories are concordant with the RampUp value; that is, as RampUp is increased, power and locking trajectories also increase. The inverse is true for the FoFR with Costs. This is because increased QAP results in more reward dilution, thereby reducing the FoFR with costs.\n\n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S1Yx1G33h.png)\n*Fig 3: RBP Trajectories considered to model the transition dynamics whereby SPs increase their onboarding before policy update to optimize FoFR trajectories.*", "metadata": {}}}
