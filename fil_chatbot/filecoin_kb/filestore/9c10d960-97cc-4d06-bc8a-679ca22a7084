In order to investigate this quantity, we plot below the time series of the base fee (top left), its statistical properties (top right), and a box-and-whiskers plot of its distribution, both in nanoFIL/gas unit (bottom left) and in logarithmic scale (bottom right).\n\n\n\n| ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkunUKjg2.png) | ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJGpvYse2.png) |\n|---|---|\n|  ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyXDDFjen.png) | ![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByimPtoeh.png)  |", "metadata": {}}}
