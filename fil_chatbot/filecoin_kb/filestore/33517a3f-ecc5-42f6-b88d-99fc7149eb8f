For each of these methods, we plot four quantities. On the top left plot, we plot the distribution of the time (measured in blocks) between non-zero occurrences. This can be understood as a measure of how frequently a given method is used. On the top left, we plot the histogram of its non-zero occurrences, measured in gas units. We also fit a KDE and an exponential distribution to such a distribution. On the bottom left, we plot the ACF of the times between non-zero occurrences, and on the bottom right, we plot the ACF of the gas consumption from that method.", "metadata": {}}}
