To do so, we build a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) that forecasts the amount of PSD gas used based on the amount of onboarded deal power.  This should be a strong relationship because mechanistically, onboarding power causes PSD messages to be generated. The model is trained using historical data from the network. Fig 6 shows the trained model\u2019s fit to the historical data. \n\n\n![glm_case2_historical](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sk3Q75rUp.png)\n\n*Fig 6: GLM trained on historical paired data of onboarded deal power to PSD gas used.
