Understanding FVM gas-related risks\n\n[We have already established](https://hackmd.io/7nJE364rRmeBENhK5qarjQ) that there are some thresholds of FVM-induced gas demand, where base fees become so high that it becomes a problem for Filecoin as a data storage network. Base fees that are too high may affect storage power onboarding and sector maintenance and stability.\n\nIn a similar fashion, [we have also exposed](https://hackmd.io/@cryptoecon/ByF9M4Ess) that the introduction of Interplanetary Consensus (IPC) also brings the risk of absorbing too much demand for Filecoin gas usage. Deciding when \"too much demand has been absorbed\", depends on what metric we use to determine the wellbeing of the Filecoin network.\n\nIPC is now planned to be deployed fully as an FVM application, and not a Filecoin built-in actor. This implies that the risks of gas sprawl previously associated with IPC are now to be associated with FVM itself.", "metadata": {}}}
