The variety of new applications to be deployed on FVM will bring new demand for usage of Filecoin gas. On the other hand, FVM also opens the possibility of implementing scalability solutions, which could end up absorbing demand for Filecoin gas usage.\n\n**This research project has two main goals:**\n\n1) To understand if (and under which circumstances) the FVM-induced changes in gas dynamics could turn out to be harmful to the Filecoin network. Particularly we need to understand the thresholds where the change in gas demand becomes a problem for Filecoin.\n2) To find robust solutions to be in place, preventively, before FVM-related gas demand becomes a major problem.\n\n\n\n## Part 1.
