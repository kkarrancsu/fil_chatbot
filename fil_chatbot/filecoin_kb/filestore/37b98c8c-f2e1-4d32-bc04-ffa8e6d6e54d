Both features involve dedicating a part of the token supply for these two uses. We will look into this breakdown and how it will impact token supply in a specific [report](/3Xwe-CZ8TPiC80Fg2r5qtQ).\n\nFinally, we should note that, currently, we are not considering a *membership* feature for QRDO. Qredo could implement this feature by requiring a certain amount of Staking for Clients to access particular services or features within the Qredo platform. However, this strategy is risky as it limits client adoption. Instead, the same value could be collected by charging directly for the service provided, thus increasing the value being produced and shared among network participants.", "metadata": {}}}
