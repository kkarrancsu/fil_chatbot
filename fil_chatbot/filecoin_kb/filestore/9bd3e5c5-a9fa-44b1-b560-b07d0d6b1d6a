The mechanism works as follows: if a shock event occurs, the network creates strong economic incentives for Storage Providers (SPs) to join the network.\n- While the network creates the conditions to enable recovery, the actual recovery depends on the behavior of external actors, namely SPs. \n- While network power has a path to recovery, the ratio of locked tokens to the circulating supply drops proportional to the amount of power that leaves the network. Exponentially increasing onboarding is needed for the locked-to-circulating supply ratio to recover, and the reduction in locked tokens could present a consensus risk to the network and exchange rate instability.", "metadata": {}}}
