This is an important point as it implies the collateral amount should be biased to avoid changes. \n\nAnother consideration is how much time we give operators to decide and execute on the terminations/renewals. If we give too little time, operators won't be able to make a decision and will fall under the default option (which can be either a renewal or a termination). If it too much time, then we allow operators that are exiting the network to extract additional rewards without updating their collateral.\n\n### The minimalist collateral\n\nThe processes described above aim to meet the full scope laid out in the motivation section.
