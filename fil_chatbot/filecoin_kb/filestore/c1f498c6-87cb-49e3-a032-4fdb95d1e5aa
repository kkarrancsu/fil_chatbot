Once there is alignment in the design space, we will start (co) writing the FIP. Parallel to this, we intend to run numerical simulations to verify that the proposed design does not induce any undesirable behavior, such as significantly increasing the variance of the base fee, rendering unsustainably large base fees, etc. \n</p>\n</p></span>\n</div>", "metadata": {}}}
