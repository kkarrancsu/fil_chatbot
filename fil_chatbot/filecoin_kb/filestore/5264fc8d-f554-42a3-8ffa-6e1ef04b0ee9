In this report, we describe the main results of this analysis and put forward a proposal of parameters that meet the goals previously described.\n\nWe start by showing how each scenario (independently of any specific combination of parameters) impacted key economic metrics, such as circulating supply, inflation rates, Stakers and Validators profitability, and Ecosystem Fund balance.\n\nThen, we focus on each parameter. Concretely, we describe how they impact the QRDO economy, discuss tradeoffs and make proposals for the final values of each parameter.\n\nWe finish this report with the results obtained from another Monte-Carlo simulation we ran with the final parameters and demonstrate how this design works to achieve our 3 initial goals.", "metadata": {}}}
