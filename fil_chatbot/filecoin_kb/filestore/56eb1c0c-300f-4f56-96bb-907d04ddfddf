These parameters must be generated in a setup phase called a multiparty computation ceremony). All of the participants would have to be compromised in order to compromise the batch of transactions.\n\nPolygon Hermez is a SNARK rollup that stores the proof and the compressed data from the batch of transfers.  The data availability is on the Ethereum Mainnet.  The zk rollup is open source and has permissionless coordinators.  Hermez has a decentralized auction model with validation rewards.  \n\n### Actors in L2 Solutions\n\n***Optimism***", "metadata": {}}}
