With horizontal scaling, the throughput can be proportional to the total computing power available in the network. This can fundamentally improve scaling properties, because the throughput increases with every node that gets added to the network.\n\n\u2018Plasma\u2019 is a native protocol of Ethereum which is used by Polygon\u2019s MATIC network. \u2018Plasma chains\u2019 are essentially sub-chains which have work hierarchically delegated to them by the main chain.  Polygon is secured by its own Proof of Stake consensus mechanism, where stakers lock up the MATIC token to get a reward for validating transactions.Polygon is secured by MATIC staking, which is a smaller pool of capital versus the miners who are securing Ethereum.\n\n### Plian", "metadata": {}}}
