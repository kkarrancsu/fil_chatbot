We use a random adjustment factor $a_{\\ell,t}$ to illustrate the point. \n![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ry5uvY_oh.png)\n\nThis is a rather interesting (and somewhat intuitive) result, as it shows that both approaches are the same under a specific choice of adjustment mechanism.  \n\nIn more detail, let's look at the term $a_{\\ell,t}$. Such a term can be understood as the relative intra-lane cost compared to the overall cost. Given that such a cost is, loosely speaking, a proxy for network demand and congestion, the adjustment terms can be roughly understood as the congestion in lane $ \\ell $ relative to the overall network congestion. Thus, an $a_{\\ell,t}>1$, can roughly be understood that lane $\\ell$ is busier than the overall network (per unit of gas), while $a_{\\ell,t}<1$ can roughly be understood as such a lane being comparatively less busy that the rest of the network (per unit of gas).\n\n\n#### Comments", "metadata": {}}}
