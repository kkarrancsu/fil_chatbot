That leaves us with options 1 or 3. Option 1 is better for capital allocation, since it will lead to a higher share of rewards being distributed among the operators that are not flagged. On the other hand, option 3 avoids the lopsided incentives where the network is rewarded when honest nodes are flagged. However, since operators have no control over the fraud detection system, we feel that the simplicity of the option 1 design and the fact that leads to a higher capital distribution supplants the issues that may come when honest nodes are flagged.\n\n\n:::warning\n:warning: we propose exclude the row of the flagged operator entirely since it is the option that leads to the higher capital distribution.\n:::\n\n### L2s payouts", "metadata": {}}}
