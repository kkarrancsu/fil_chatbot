One of the classical constructions for time-lock puzzles utilizes the repeated squaring method in RSA groups, as mentioned in the context of VDFs, however, while this requires a minimum number of operations to be solved, it is highly sensitive to improvements in software or algorithms.", "metadata": {}}}
