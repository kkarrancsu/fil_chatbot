TTFB measures how quickly the node responded to the request. This metric will be initially estimated by Saturn using generated traffic. Then, once we start integrating clients, we can use the client's logs to estimate TTFB.\n* Download speed - how quickly the client downloads all the requested. Download speed measures how long it took for node to fulfill the request and, thus, how long the user had to wait to receive the full content. The metric can be taken from the transfer logs using the column `request_duration_sec`.\n\nNote that download speed is often limited on the client's end. In other words, a node may often be able to upload content to a client at 100Mbps, but the node may be on a cellular connection and is only able to download content at 20Mbps.", "metadata": {}}}
