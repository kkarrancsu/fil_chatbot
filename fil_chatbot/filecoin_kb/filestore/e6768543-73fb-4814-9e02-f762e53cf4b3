Incentivizing certain regions by providing bigger rewards would be more easily addressed using multiple pools. This will be something to tackle in later versions, once we have a clearer idea of where the users and node operators are located.\n:::\n\n#### Bandwidth scoring function\n\nWhen scoring bandwidth, the higher the bandwidth, the larger the share of rewards should be. Thus, not only the scoring function needs to meet criteria defined above, but it also needs to be strictly monotonically increasing. We can achieve this using a positive power of the bandwidth fraction. More concretely, if we have:\n\n- $n$ node operators ($i=1, 2, ..., n$)\n- $b_i$: total bandwidth served by node operator $i$ in the current epoch\n\nThe rewards paid to node operator $i$ in the current epoch are defined by the following **scoring function**:\n\n$S(b_i) := \\frac{b_i^k}{\\sum_{j=1}^n b_j^k}$", "metadata": {}}}
