It provides an open Web3 protocol, framework and tooling to develop and host applications, interfaces and backends on permissionless peer-to-peer networks. The Web3 stack enables \n\n(1) programmable network requests \n\n(2) distributed applications from composition without centralization\n\n(3) extensibility through adapter/wrapper services\n\n(4) efficiencies and improved time to market arising from the reuse of deployed services and significantly reduced devops requirements.\n\n**Tech**\n\nFluence is a P2P compute layer, **not a blockchain/incentive layer**.  It aims to provide P2P compute nodes, targeting applications in web3, storage, and blockchain domains. In this it supports IPFS. \n\nThe types of computation and environment it uses are announceable/discoverable.", "metadata": {}}}
