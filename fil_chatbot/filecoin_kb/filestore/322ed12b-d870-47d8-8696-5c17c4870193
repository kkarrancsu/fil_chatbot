They are based on idealised scenarios, and the exploration should be treated as a tool to show relative differences and build design-space understanding. All interpretations of the analysis must be conditioned on the assumptions given below. All absolute value predictions should be interpreted with caution, especially far into the future. None of the analysis comes with any guarantees but the underlying model is open-source and available to be reviewed and improved.\n\n**Termination incentives model assumptions**", "metadata": {}}}
