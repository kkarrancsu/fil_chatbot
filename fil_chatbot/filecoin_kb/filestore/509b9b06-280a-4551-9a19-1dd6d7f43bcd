Furthermore, from the figure on the right, we can see that the rate of change on which circulating supply decreases with respect to $a$ is rather pronounced for smaller values of this parameter and becomes milder as $a$ increases. This is indeed an intuitive result since the release rate function decreases as a function of $a$ for the specific choice of rate function considered, i.e., \n\n\\begin{aligned}\nr(\\mathsf{TVL},N^\\text{val}):=r_\\text{max}\\left((1-b)\\cdot\\min\\left(1,\\frac{\\mathsf{TVL}}{\\mathsf{TVL}_\\text{target}}\\right)^a+b\\cdot\\min\\left(1,\\frac{N^\\text{val}}{N^\\text{val}_\\text{target}}\\right)^a\\right),\n\\end{aligned}", "metadata": {}}}
