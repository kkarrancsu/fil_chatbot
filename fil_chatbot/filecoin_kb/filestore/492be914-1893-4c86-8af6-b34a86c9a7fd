In this mechanism, we are simply ignoring flagged logs and, thus, node operators have their rewards slightly reduced because we are ignoring the fake logs. \n2. *Give a penalty to the total reward of flagged nodes*. Here a general penalty is applied to the total reward expected to be paid to node operators. This is an individual incentive and directly targets the expected reward of nodes. In addition, this setting allows us to penalize behaviors that can only be detected at the node level (e.g., an impossibly high number of requests served).\n3. *Give a penalty to L1 nodes based on how many flagged entities exist in their swarm*. This mechanism aims to discourage collusion between L1 nodes and their swarm. By penalizing L1 nodes based on how their swarm behaves, we incent L1 nodes to report trustfully about how their swarm is performing.", "metadata": {}}}
