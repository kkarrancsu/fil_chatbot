Let us define $B_m$ as miner $m$'s average gas consumption rate, the amount of gas they are expected to use on a given block.\n\nWe can see the breakdown of gas usage in filecoin below, where all of the gas usage methods except \"Others\" correspond to SP activity. We see that SP activity makes up the vast majority of gas usage.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NzfMaks.png)\n\n\nThe SP utility is then,\n$$ u_m=\\sum_{j\\in B\\in M}(p_j-r-\\mu)\\cdot g_j+W_m\\left(\\frac{S}{S-r\\left(\\sum_{j\\in B\\in M} g_j+ B_m\\right)}-1\\right)-r\\cdot B_m$$\n\nThe introduction of the new negative term, $-r\\cdot B_m$ means this utility function is no longer maximized\n\n**The main complication is that what quantity needs to be optimized varies from \nSP to SP, one cannot come up with one target to optimize that will make all SPs happy at once**.", "metadata": {}}}
