The reason for this is twofold. On one hand, larger slopes mean a larger initial pledge. On the other hand, larger slopes and/or average network durations mean that the share of rewards gets smaller faster because the entire network QAP is growing faster.\n\nHowever, as the sealing date moves forward, the annualized FoFR recovers to a more or less stable trajectory. This long-term value seems to be impacted by the lock target and by the network's average duration. Interestingly, if we introduce a duration multiplier, the actual slope does not seem to have an impact on SPs' returns in the long run. The only impact they have is to introduce volatility, with higher slopes leading to larger initial drops in FoFR and shaper recoveries to the long-term trend. Because of this, smaller slopes seem to be preferable.\n\n\n## Annex - additional plots", "metadata": {}}}
