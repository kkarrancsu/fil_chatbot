Incentive Considerations\n\nErring on the side of miners *might* reduce network revenue, but can be balanced with FEVM demand if demand is high (which is why we propose this anyways). On the other hand, however, having *easy access* to M&O messages might, in turn, promote onboarding. \n\n\n\n\n## 6. Product Considerations\n\n### 6.1 UX/UI\n\nIntroducing gas lanes adds an additional layer of complexity to the user interface, however, reserving enough block space for maintenance and onboarding operations (and hence, introducing some *control* on the base fee for these messages) can, in turn, encourage a larger volume of onboarding.\n\n\n### 6.2 Multi-dimensional knapsack\n Gas lanes introduce a more complicated optimization problem. Instead of just considering gas fees, nodes or miners need to also evaluate which lane a transaction belongs to, and how it fits into the current distribution of lanes.\n\n\n## 7.
