For the unfamiliar reader, the Gini index is an econometric measure of concentration, typically applied to wealth inequality. The Gini index ranges from 0 to 1. A Gini index of 0 means equal distribution of resources, and a Gini index of 1 means that all resources are held by precisely one agent (i.e., extreme concentration). In this scenario, a Gini index of 0 would imply that all storage power is equally distributed among all miners.", "metadata": {}}}
