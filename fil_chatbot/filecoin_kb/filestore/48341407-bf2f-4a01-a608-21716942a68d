Here, the network achieves TVL rates between 10% and 60%, which we plot against the corresponding Staker APR. We also color each pair of TVL and APR with the corresponding token or scenario.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\">\n<img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyXVNpctn.png\"><img width=\"50%\" src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyIHV65Kn.png\">\n\n**Figure 3.2.2:** Staker APR vs. TVL - optimistic scenarios of staking sentiment\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n\n\nAs expected, as the TVL rate increases the APR decreases. However, when the TVL rate is higher than 30%, we see that most simulation runs lead to APRs ranging between 5% and 15%.
