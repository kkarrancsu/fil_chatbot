Recall that these tokens will be immediately burned. We will refer to these tokens as $L_\\text{burn}^\\text{out}(t)$.\n- Tokens from the Ecosystem Fund are released to pay Validators and Stakers for their role in the federated PoS consensus mechanism. We will refer to these tokens as $L_\\text{fee}^\\text{out}(t)$.\n- Stakers release their locked tokens to stop participating in the federated PoS consensus mechanism. We will refer to these tokens as $L_\\text{stake}^\\text{out}(t)$.\n\n\nTherefore, we can define the number of tokens released from locking during step $t$ as:\n\n$$\nL^\\text{out}(t) = \n    L_\\text{burn}^\\text{out}(t)\n    + L_\\text{fee}^\\text{out}(t)\n    + L_\\text{stake}^\\text{out}(t)\n$$", "metadata": {}}}
