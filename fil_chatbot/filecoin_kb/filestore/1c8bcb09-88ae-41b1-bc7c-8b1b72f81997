In particular,w e will focus on the case where $\\tilde{G}_t>0.99$, i.e., how does the gas consumption move in the next block, given that it is currently at capacity. Here we look at the histogram, the empirical CDF, and the ACF, as shown below.  \n \n \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/1O5Tfwe.png)\n\n\nWe can see that there is a non-negligible mass at $\\tilde{G}_t>0.99$ (accounting for about 4.1% of the total mass) and that the ACF decays almost immediately to 0, implying that there is a very weak autocorrelation in this series. Furthermore, we have that:\n\n\n | Quantity \t|  Estimated probability \t| 95% standard error\t|\n|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n| $\\mathbb{P}(\\tilde{G}_{t+1}\\geq0.99 \\text{ given that } \\tilde{G}_t\\geq0.99)$ \t|0.041 \t| 0.007 \t|\n\n\nThe summary statistics of $\\tilde{G}_{t+1}|\\tilde{G}_{t}>0.99$, are given by:", "metadata": {}}}
