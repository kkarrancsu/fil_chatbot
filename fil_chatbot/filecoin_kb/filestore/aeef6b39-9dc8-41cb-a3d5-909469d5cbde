Therefore, this will be a parameter we will tune during the simulation analysis.\n\n\n#### Download times scoring function\n\nFor TTFB and download speed, we cannot directly use the functions we used for bandwidth. The reason is two-fold:\n\n1. Having lower download times is a good thing, which means the scoring function needs to be monotonically decreasing.\n2. Nodes may contribute both positively and negatively to the network's download times. In other words, if many nodes join the network with a high times, they can lower the entire network performance. On the other hand, for bandwidth, nodes can only add more bandwidth, so they cannot negatively affect the network on that particular metric.", "metadata": {}}}
