Furthermore, if clients simply want the results for their computations can they request those from a temporary storage location.  Finally, how does the new storage contract work if the client want to (more or less) permanently store the data. Perhaps a storage contract can be combined with the compute contract.*  \n\n### **Storage Provider**\n\nValue flows to the storage providers in terms of fees for processing the data and from the storage of results.  *Note:  This brings up an interesting question as to what rate storage providers can charge for storing results and whether results must be stored with the same provider.*  \n\n### **Validators**", "metadata": {}}}
