This would freeze the state and users would not be able to withdraw, but the attacker\u2019s stake would also be frozen.  This is still a much stronger guarantee than sidechains, because no hack can be directly exploited and there is no economic benefit from being compromised. Moreover, guardian nodes can run on consumer hardware, so they don\u2019t require delegated PoS. This means much higher decentralization and hence digital security.  A hacker would need to break thousands of guardian nodes to control the majority of the stake.\n\n### Polygon\n\nPolygon paid $400M to buy Mir, a startup building ZK tech.
