During network congestion, gas fees increase commensurate with demand according to a strategy similar to EIP-1559. The Sequencer charges a single, small gas fee that covers two costs: (1) a gas fee to pay for the L1 rollup transaction (also called L1 security fee or publishing fee; the fee is split among the L2 transactions) and (2) an L2 Sequencer gas fee for the work performed to execute the transaction.  Another small fee is charged for a swap or liquidity deposit.  Typically the L1 security fee is much higher than the L2 execution fee so it can make sense to wait for low congestion to complete the L1 transaction.", "metadata": {}}}
