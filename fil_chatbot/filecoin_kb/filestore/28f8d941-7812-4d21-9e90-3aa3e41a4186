Token unlocking could also reveal other risk factors not explored in these simulations.\n\n\n## 2. Methods and Experiments\nWe utilize an Agent-Based Model (ABM) of the Filecoin network to simulate shock scenarios. For a detailed description of the ABM, please view our [research report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.15200.pdf) on using ABMs to model utility based cryptoeconomies, published at the Chainscience 2023 conference.\n\nTo model the shock scenario, we simulate a population of three types of SPs: FIL+ SPs, CC SPs, and Mixed SPs.  FIL+ SPs only have FIL+ sectors, CC SPs only have CC sectors, and mixed SPs have both CC and FIL+ sectors with a configured split. A percentage of each type of SP then leaves the network by not onboarding any new power or renewing any expiring sectors. The proportion of SP types and the percentage of SPs which leave the network is configurable.", "metadata": {}}}
