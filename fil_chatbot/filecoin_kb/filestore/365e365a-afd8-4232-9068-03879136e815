Notice that the time indices in the previous equation can also be taken as moving averages over some given number of epochs $T$.  This approach has the advantage of being quite straightforward, once $\\alpha$ has been defined. \n\nNotice that if the network becomes so large that $w_{2,t+1}\\ll w_{1,t+1}$, there's a clear scalability issue (as this would mean that the network maintenance is taking almost all available resources) and as such we would need to resort to layer 2 solutions.\n\n**Example IV.** We now consider a slightly more abstract example. Let $\\pi_{\\ell} \\in(0,1)$ be a *priority factor* for lane $\\ell$, where a higher value indicates higher priority for messages in lane $\\ell$. Given this, one could update $w_{\\ell,t}$ on an epoch-to-epoch basis using the following procedure.", "metadata": {}}}
