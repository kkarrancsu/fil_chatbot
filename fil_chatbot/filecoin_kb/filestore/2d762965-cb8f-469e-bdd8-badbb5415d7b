But, this is only useful if individual SPs retain a strong FIL-denominated profit margin. Both parts are needed to achieve the network\u2019s long-termist storage goals.\n\nSo the question arises, what is the impact on profitability? Simulations indicate SPs retain a strong profit margin. And furthermore we find this conclusion is robust to 50% joint variation in onboarding, FIL+ rate, and renewal levels. An example is set out in Figure 4A, which shows the percentage rate of return from sealing a 1 year sector within the next 12 months. While the annualized percentage return is lower in the short term following the slope 2 proposal compared to \u2018no change\u2019, the main effect is to accelerates the network reaching the more sustainable behavior.", "metadata": {}}}
