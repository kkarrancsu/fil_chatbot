However, before they renew, the multiplier is the original 10x multiplier on Fil+ deals.\n* We are not changing the multiplier of currently active deals.\n* The quality multiplier for new onboards will depend on the rate of Fil+ deals ($\\textrm{fil_plus_rate}$), the expected sector duration ($lo$), the multiplier for Fil+ deals ($m_{Fil+}$), and the duration multiplier function ($m_{dur}(t)$), which depends on the sector duration $t$.\n* The duration multiplier function is a user input and will be one of the focus to tune during our simulations\n\n\nUnder these assumptions, the equations for the raw-byte power remain unchanged. We only need to update the daily QA power onboarded (as expected!) and QA renewals (since renewed sectors may have a different multiplier based on the renewal length).", "metadata": {}}}
