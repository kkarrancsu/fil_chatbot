Using a more sophisticated approach we can mimic how SPs would have behaved if Fil+ was never implemented. To simulate this, we use historical data to learn the behavior of SPs in the current network where Fil+ exists. Specifically, we learn a mapping from the network's Fil-on-Fil Returns (FoFR) to the total amount of power onboarded onto the network. We then rewind the network to 2022-01-01, approximately when deal sectors started to be onboarded onto the network and simulate the scenario where Fil+ was not implemented.\n\nTwo types of SPs are considered in this counterfactual, CC SPs and RD (Regular Deal) SPs. The CC SPs behave the same as they did when Fil+ existed. As for RD SPs, we test two behaviors: 1) they behave the same as CC SPs, and 2) they behave the same as Fil+ SPs.  Behavior is defined as the amount of power the SP will onboard for a given network FoFR value.", "metadata": {}}}
