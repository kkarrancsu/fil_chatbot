While it is tempting to attribute this increase in base fee to the introduction of the Filecoin-Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM), it is worth noting that the volatility for such a base fee has been increasing since around one month before FEVM launched. Furthermore, as described [here](https://hackmd.io/@cryptoecon/HyED5m4f2), the gas usage due to FEVM has been significantly smaller than for non-FEVM-related messages. This suggests that increased volatility in base fees can be attributed --at least partly-- to other factors, such as higher network activity and growth. \n- the 25% and 50% quantiles have been smaller in 2023 than in 2022. This roughly means that the bottom 50% of epochs (in terms of base fee) in 2023 have had a smaller base fee than the bottom 50% of epochs in 2022.", "metadata": {}}}
